Step 1
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I need to determine what is in the uploaded image. To do so, I need to identify the file name or path of any uploaded image by listing the files in the working directory, and then use the visualizer tool to answer the question about the image content.

Code:
```py
files = list_dir(".")
print("Files in the current directory:", files)
```
======== example_app ========
Executing parsed code:
files = list_dir(".")
print("Files in the current directory:", files)
======== example_app ========
Step 2
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The directory is empty, meaning no image has been uploaded. Therefore, I cannot analyze what is in the image.

Code:
```py
final_answer("There is no uploaded image in the current directory, so I cannot determine what is in it.")
```
======== example_app ========
Executing parsed code:
final_answer("There is no uploaded image in the current directory, so I cannot determine what is in it.")
