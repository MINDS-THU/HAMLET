Tell me what is in your knowledge base
======== example_app ========
Step 1
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To answer what is in the knowledge base, I need to explore its directory structure. I'll start by listing the root directory of the knowledge base to see what top-level folders or files are available.
Code:
```py
root_contents = list_knowledge_base_directory("")
print(root_contents)
```
======== example_app ========
Executing parsed code:
root_contents = list_knowledge_base_directory("")
print(root_contents)
======== example_app ========
Step 2
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The output from listing the root directory was "None", which suggests either the root directory may be empty or possibly that I need to specify a different path or that there might be an issue with access. To verify, I will try listing the contents of a common default directory name, such as ".", to see if that yields any different output.

Code:
```py
root_contents_dot = list_knowledge_base_directory(".")
print(root_contents_dot)
```
======== example_app ========
Executing parsed code:
root_contents_dot = list_knowledge_base_directory(".")
print(root_contents_dot)
======== example_app ========
Step 3
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Both attempts to list the knowledge base directory ("", ".") returned "None". This suggests that either the knowledge base is empty, not mounted, or there is no accessible content at the top level or current default location. To further troubleshoot, I will try to search for any files by performing a semantic search with a generic query (like "a") to see if it retrieves any entries, which can sometimes discover files in the absence of directory listings.

Code:
```py
semantic_results = semantic_search_knowledge_base(query="a")
print(semantic_results)
```
======== example_app ========
Executing parsed code:
semantic_results = semantic_search_knowledge_base(query="a")
print(semantic_results)
