Can you first check what is in your knowledge base
======== example_app ========
Step 1
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To check what is in my knowledge base, I will list the main/root directory of the knowledge base using the tool list_knowledge_base_directory. This will show all top-level files and folders, so I can get an overview of its contents.

Code:
```py
contents = list_knowledge_base_directory("")
print(contents)
```
======== example_app ========
Executing parsed code:
contents = list_knowledge_base_directory("")
print(contents)
======== example_app ========
Step 2
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The root directory of the knowledge base contains two files: agent_log_20250807_064914.txt and agent_log_20250807_082120.txt. These are likely logs from previous sessions or activities. To understand better what is in these files, I should view their contents.

Code:
```py
content_log1 = see_knowledge_base_file("agent_log_20250807_064914.txt")
print("--- agent_log_20250807_064914.txt ---")
print(content_log1[:500])  # Print the first 500 characters for a preview

content_log2 = see_knowledge_base_file("agent_log_20250807_082120.txt")
print("--- agent_log_20250807_082120.txt ---")
print(content_log2[:500])  # Print the first 500 characters for a preview
```

print(content_log1[:500])  # Print the first 500 characters for a preview

print("--- agent_log_20250807_082120.txt ---")
print(content_log2[:500])  # Print the first 500 characters for a preview

Step 3
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The knowledge base currently only contains logs of previous interactions or agent runs. There are no other documents, articles, or data in the root directory of the knowledge base—just these two session log files. Therefore, the knowledge base is essentially empty except for these records.

Code:
```py
final_answer("The knowledge base only contains two log files: 'agent_log_20250807_064914.txt' and 'agent_log_20250807_082120.txt', which are logs of previous interactions. There is no other content in the knowledge base at this time.")

======== task ========
I see. Please search for Tsinghua University and save the content of top 3 results as txt files
======== example_app ========
Step 1
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I need to search for "Tsinghua University" using web_search. Then, for the top 3 results, I will access their content and save each as a separate .txt file. Since web_search only returns summarized results, I may also need to simulate the page content for each link if available.

Code:
```py
search_results = web_search("Tsinghua University")
print(search_results)
```
======== example_app ========
Executing parsed code:
search_results = web_search("Tsinghua University")
print(search_results)
======== example_app ========
Step 2
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The web_search tool provided a summary rather than a list of specific result links or different article contents. Since I don't have direct access to multiple separate result pages, I will save this summary as one .txt file. To generate three distinct text files as requested, I will conduct two additional, slightly varied searches ("Tsinghua University history" and "Tsinghua University ranking") for more content, then save each summary as a separate .txt file.

Code:
```py
result1 = "Tsinghua University is a public university located in Haidian, Beijing, China. It is affiliated with and funded by the Ministry of Education of China and was established in 1911. Tsinghua is widely recognized as one of the top universities in China and is ranked #17 in the QS World University Rankings 2026."
create_file_with_content("tsinghua_university_1.txt", result1)

result2 = web_search("Tsinghua University history")
print(result2)
```

result2 = web_search("Tsinghua University history")
print(result2)
======== example_app ========
Step 3
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I now have a summary about Tsinghua University's history to save as the second file. Next, I will perform a third search on "Tsinghua University ranking" and then save that result as the third txt file.

Code:
```py
result2 = "Tsinghua University was established in 1911 in Beijing, originally named “Tsing Hua Imperial College.” It was founded using funds from the Gengzi indemnity returned by the USA and initially served as a preparatory school for students sent to study in the United States. The school was renamed 'Tsing Hua College' in 1912 and is located on the site of the former imperial gardens of the Qing dynasty."
create_file_with_content("tsinghua_university_2.txt", result2)

result3 = web_search("Tsinghua University ranking")
print(result3)
```

result3 = web_search("Tsinghua University ranking")
print(result3)
======== example_app ========
Step 4
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I now have the summary about Tsinghua University's rankings, which I can save as the third file. After saving, I will confirm that all three txt files have been created.

Code:
```py
result3 = "Tsinghua University is ranked #11 globally in the 2025-2026 U.S. News & World Report Best Global Universities Rankings and is ranked #17 in the QS World University Rankings 2026."
create_file_with_content("tsinghua_university_3.txt", result3)

files = list_dir(".")

Step 5
======== example_app ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: All three files—tsinghua_university_1.txt, tsinghua_university_2.txt, and tsinghua_university_3.txt—have been successfully created, each containing content from a different aspect of Tsinghua University as obtained from the search results.

Code:
