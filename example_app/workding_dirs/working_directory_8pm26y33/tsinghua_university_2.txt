Tsinghua University was established in 1911 in Beijing, originally named “Tsing Hua Imperial College.” It was founded using funds from the Gengzi indemnity returned by the USA and initially served as a preparatory school for students sent to study in the United States. The school was renamed 'Tsing Hua College' in 1912 and is located on the site of the former imperial gardens of the Qing dynasty.
