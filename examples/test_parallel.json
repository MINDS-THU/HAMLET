The code sequence must be opened with '<code>', and closed with '</code>'.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nYou can give more than one code block in a single step if you don't know which is quicker or better. Note that any one of these code blocks should be able to complete the task of this step independently. If you give several code blocks, you should also specify Check Method, which is either 'code' or 'prompt'.\nIf you specify 'code', you must also provide Check Code, which is a code snippet that will be run after each code block to check if the code block has successfully completed the task of this step. In your Check Code, you can directly use any variables defined in the previous code block (They have the same name and type), and you should store the result of the check in a bool variable named 'check_result'. The Check Code should be common to all code blocks, it is supposed that you are only given any one of the results of code blocks. You are not allowed to use notional tools in Check Code. The Check Code part must be clearly point out with 'Check Code:', then provide your codes opened with '<code>' and closed with '</code>'.\nIf you specify 'prompt', you must also provide Check Prompt, which is a text prompt that will be used to check if the code block has successfully completed the task of this step. You should first briefly describe the task of this step and then give one or more simple criteria in the Check Prompt. Your criteria must be only specific to a certain print output of the code blocks (DONOT mention other code print outputs and content of all the code blocks), it is supposed that you are only given any one of the print outputs of code blocks. Note that the criteria should be based on the print outputs in the code blocks, and you are suggested to add some context about the print outputs in your previous code blocks. The Check Prompt section must be clearly point out with 'Check Prompt:', then provide your prompts enclosed in triple quotes \"\"\" like in Python.\nIf you trust that all code blocks will complete the task of this step (for instance the task is very simple), you can choose the Check Method 'code' and directly set 'result = True' in the Check Code. \nEither Check Code or Check Prompt must be provided if you give more than one code block, and it should be common to all code blocks. Once any one of the code block passes the check, all other code blocks will be shutdown immediately.

I will use two Python code blocks to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool.

Use the tool `wikipedia_search` to find the country where the Eiffel Tower is located, then find its capital, or 2. Use the tool `web_search` to find the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located. I will use two code blocks to find the answer and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool. The user has provided a criteria that the answer contains the letter 'P', so I will use that to check if the code blocks have successfully completed the task.\nCode#1:\n<code>\n# Using wikipedia_search to find the country and its capital\ncountry = wikipedia_search(query=\"Eiffel Tower country\")\ncapital = wikipedia_search(query=f\"{country} capital\")\nfinal_answer(f\"The capital found is {capital}\")\n</code>\nCode#2:\n<code>\n# Using web_search to find the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located\ncapital = web_search(query=\"capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located\")\nprint(f\"The capital found is {capital}\")\nfinal_answer(capital)\n</code>\nCheck Method: prompt\nCheck Prompt: \"\"\"Task: What is the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located? Criteria: The answer contains the letter 'P'.\"\"\"\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef list_dir(directory: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"List files in the chosen directory. Use this to explore the directory structure. Note: only files under the allowed working directory are accessible.\n\n    Args:\n        directory: The directory to check.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef see_text_file(filename: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"View the content of a chosen plain text file (e.g., .txt, .md, .py, .log). Not suitable for binary files such as .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, or images.Note: only files under the working directory are accessible.\n\n    Args:\n        filename: Name of the file to check.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef modify_file(filename: string, start_line: integer, end_line: integer, new_content: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Modify a plain text file by replacing specific lines with new content. Only works with plain text files (e.g., .txt, .py, .md). Ensure correct indentation. Not applicable for binary files such as .pdf, .docx, or spreadsheets.\n\n    Args:\n        filename: Name of the file to modify.\n        start_line: Start line number to replace.\n        end_line: End line number to replace.\n        new_content: New content to insert (with proper indentation).\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef create_file_with_content(filename: string, content: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Create a new plain text file (e.g., .txt, .py, .md) and write content into it.

This tool does not support creating binary files such as .pdf, .docx, or images.\n\n    Args:\n        filename: Name of the file to create.\n        content: Content to write into the file.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions(except Check Code): so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Use more than one method to compute concurrently. It is known that the answer is between 5000 and 5100\"\nThought: The task can be solved in two ways: 1. Use a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, or 2. Use a loop to compute the sum. I will use two Python code blocks to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool. The user has provided a criteria that the answer is between 5000 and 5100, so I will use that to check if the code blocks have successfully completed the task.\nCode#1:\n<code>\n# Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series\nn = 100\ntotal = n * (n + 1) // 2\nfinal_answer(total)\n</code>\nCode#2:\n<code>\n# Using a loop to compute the sum\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, 101):\n    total += i\nfinal_answer(total)\n</code>\nCheck Method: code\nCheck Code:\n<code>\n# Check if the variable 'total' is between 5000 and 5100\ncheck_result = 5000 < total < 5100\n</code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located? Use more than one method to find the answer concurrently. It is known that the answer contains the letter 'P'.\"\nThought: The task can be solved in two ways: 1. Use the tool `wikipedia_search` to find the country where the Eiffel Tower is located, then find its capital, or 2. Use the tool `web_search` to find the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located. I will use two code blocks to find the answer and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool. The user has provided a criteria that the answer contains the letter 'P', so I will use that to check if the code blocks have successfully completed the task.\nCode#1:\n<code>\n# Using wikipedia_search to find the country and its capital\ncountry = wikipedia_search(query=\"Eiffel Tower country\")\ncapital = wikipedia_search(query=f\"{country} capital\")\nfinal_answer(f\"The capital found is {capital}\")\n</code>\nCode#2:\n<code>\n# Using web_search to find the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located\ncapital = web_search(query=\"capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located\")\nprint(f\"The capital found is {capital}\")\nfinal_answer(capital)\n</code>\nCheck Method: prompt\nCheck Prompt: \"\"\"Task: What is the capital of the country where the Eiffel Tower is located? Criteria: The answer contains the letter 'P'.\"\"\"\n\nAbove examples were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n<code>\ndef list_dir(directory: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"List files in the chosen directory. Use this to explore the directory structure. Note: only files under the allowed working directory are accessible.\n\n    Args:\n        directory: The directory to check.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef see_text_file(filename: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"View the content of a chosen plain text file (e.g., .txt, .md, .py, .log). Not suitable for binary files such as .pdf, .docx, .xlsx, or images.Note: only files under the working directory are accessible.\n\n    Args:\n        filename: Name of the file to check.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef modify_file(filename: string, start_line: integer, end_line: integer, new_content: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Modify a plain text file by replacing specific lines with new content. Only works with plain text files (e.g., .txt, .py, .md). Ensure correct indentation. Not applicable for binary files such as .pdf, .docx, or spreadsheets.\n\n    Args:\n        filename: Name of the file to modify.\n        start_line: Start line number to replace.\n        end_line: End line number to replace.\n        new_content: New content to insert (with proper indentation).\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef create_file_with_content(filename: string, content: string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Create a new plain text file (e.g., .txt, .py, .md) and write content into it. If parent folders in the specified path do not exist, they will be created automatically. This tool does not support creating binary files such as .pdf, .docx, or images.\n\n    Args:\n        filename: Name of the file to create.\n        content: Content to write into the file.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n</code>\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a '<code>' sequence ending with '</code>', else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. For tools WITHOUT JSON output schema: Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, as their output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search without a JSON output schema has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. For tools WITH JSON output schema: You can confidently chain multiple tool calls and directly access structured output fields in the same code block! When a tool has a JSON output schema, you know exactly what fields and data types to expect, allowing you to write robust code that directly accesses the structured response (e.g., result['field_name']) without needing intermediate print() statements.\n6. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n7. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n8. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n9. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n10. The state persists between code executions(except Check Code): so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n11. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"
