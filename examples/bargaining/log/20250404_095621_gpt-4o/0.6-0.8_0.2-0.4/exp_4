Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I need to initiate the negotiation by sending a message to express my interest and to indicate that I'm open to negotiating on the price. Starting with a low initial anchor will help me maximize my utility as a buyer.

**Code:**
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the TCL 65-Inch QM8 QLED TV. I noticed it's listed at $1199.99. Are you open to negotiation on the price?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has expressed interest in the TCL 65-Inch QM8 QLED TV and is inquiring about the possibility of negotiating the price. My goal is to start with a strong position close to the listing price to anchor the negotiation at a high point. This will allow room for concessions while still aiming to maximize my utility. I'll make an offer slightly below the listing price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate but still maintain a favorable position.

**Code:**
```py

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has made an offer of $1150, which is still too high compared to my target. I should counter with a significantly lower offer to set the tone for negotiation and leave plenty of room for adjustments. I will suggest a price well below my bottom line to avoid negative utility and aim for a favorable deal.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has made an offer of $750, which is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1150. This offer is also far from my bottom line of $398.37. To continue negotiations, I'll counter with a price that is significantly higher than the buyer's offer but shows some concession from my last offer. This will help move the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome for me while keeping the discussions open.

**Code:**

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller is now at $925, very close to my maximum limit. While this offer is slightly above my preferred price, it’s a reasonable deal compared to my maximum of $897.92. I should try to negotiate a little more, staying firm but open for an agreement.
