======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As the buyer, I will open the negotiation with a message expressing interest in the item, followed by a low initial offer to establish a strong anchor point and create room for concessions. This will help me gauge the seller's flexibility.

Code:
```py
# Initiate negotiation with a message expressing interest in the item.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in the Zojirushi Rice Cooker. Considering some budget constraints, can we negotiate a bit on the price?")
print(message)

# Make a low initial offer to start the negotiation.
initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=250, side_offer=None)
print(initial_offer)

Output message of the LLM:
The initial message and offer have been sent to the seller. I will now wait for their response to proceed with the negotiation.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer is interested and is attempting to negotiate the price down due to budget constraints. However, their offer of 250 is significantly below the listing price and still substantially above my bottom line of 92.94, which means I can counter with a higher price while still showing some flexibility. I'll propose a counteroffer closer to the listing price to anchor high and leave room for negotiations.

**Code:**
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=400, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have made a counteroffer at 400, which is still a significant discount from the listing price but much higher than the buyer's initial offer. I will wait for the buyer's response to see if they accept, counter, or express further challenges. This will help gauge how flexible they might be and adjust my strategy accordingly.

response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with an offer of 400. This is above my target range, and also above my bottom line of 305.84. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, while still keeping it below my maximum limit, to show willingness to negotiate while aiming to stay as low as possible.

Code:
```py
# Counter with a higher offer than my initial one but still below my maximum limit.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has raised their offer to 280, which shows some flexibility and willingness to increase the price. However, this is still below the midpoint between my counteroffer and their previous offer. I can aim to increase their offer further by making another counteroffer that is slightly below my previous one, keeping the negotiation going but showing a bit of flexibility.

```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=370, side_offer=None)

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've sent a counteroffer at 370, which still represents a decent concession from my end but aims to bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'll wait for the buyer's next move, as this will help me understand how close we are to reaching a potential agreement.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has brought the price down to 370. This is still above my target and maximum limit. I will counter with an offer slightly higher than my previous one, while emphasizing my budget constraints to reinforce my position.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to 300, indicating they might be nearing their limit. Although the offer is still below my previous counteroffer, it is a sizable increase from their earlier offer and remains above my bottom line. I can consider accepting this offer as it provides a reasonable utility, while ensuring the sale goes through, potentially maximizing my utility given their stated budget constraints.

```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)

Output message of the LLM:
