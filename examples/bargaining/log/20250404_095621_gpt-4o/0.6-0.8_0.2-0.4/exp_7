Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, I should start with a strong but low offer to establish a negotiating advantage. I need to show interest but also imply that my budget is limited, to push for a lower price.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer's offer of $120 is significantly below our listing price of $199.99, but it's above the bottomline of $64.23. I want to counter with a higher price to negotiate closer to our listing price while keeping a balance between being assertive and encouraging the buyer to continue negotiating.

**Thought:** The seller has countered with an offer of $179.99, which is above my maximum limit of $145.79. I need to counter this with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, while still well below my maximum limit. This should indicate that I am willing to negotiate but still hold firm on staying below my maximum budget.
