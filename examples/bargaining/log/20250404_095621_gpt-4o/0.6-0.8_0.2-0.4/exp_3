Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, I will begin the negotiation by making an initial offer that is well below the listing price, which is $174.99. This strategy will serve as an anchor to negotiate toward a more favorable price, leaving room for concessions over time. I'll leverage my position by emphasizing how my budget is constrained and suggest that I'm considering other options.

**Code:**
```py
# Making an initial offer significantly below the listing price to open the negotiation.
initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=110, side_offer=None)
print(initial_offer)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has offered $110, which is closer to my listing price than the bottomline price. According to my strategy, I should aim to anchor the negotiation closer to the listing price. I will counter with an offer closer to $174.99 and emphasize the quality and features of the product to justify the higher price.
  
**Code:**
```py
# Counter with a higher offer and emphasize product value

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has countered with an offer of $160, which is below the listing price but still above my target range. I will use this opportunity to stress my budget constraints and reiterate the availability of similar products at lower prices. I will make a counteroffer slightly higher than my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility, aiming to settle closer to my bottom line.

**Code:**
```py

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have made a counteroffer at $125. I'll wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to move closer to my target price. This price still gives me room to negotiate slightly given the utility maximization goal.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to $125, which shows a willingness to negotiate upwards. I can counter with another offer that is slightly lower than my previous counter-offer to show some flexibility but still maximize my utility. I'll aim for $150 and emphasize that this is a fair price considering the product's value and features.

**Code:**
```py
# Counter with a slightly lower offer while emphasizing the value of the product
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="The price I'm offering is quite reasonable considering the long-term reliability and performance of the Seagate IronWolf 8TB NAS Hard Drive.")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has made a concession by reducing the price to $150. While this is a good movement, it is still above what I aim to pay. I will acknowledge the seller's position and make one more move closer to my maximum acceptable price. I'll counter with $135, which is just above halfway between our current positions, emphasizing that it's close to my budget limit.
