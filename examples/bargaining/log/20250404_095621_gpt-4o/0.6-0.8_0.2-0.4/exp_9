Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To begin the negotiation, I will start by sending a message to express interest in the item and subtly indicate my willingness to negotiate. This initial engagement sets the stage for making an offer that anchors below the seller's listing price.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer is interested in the monitor and is asking if I'm open to negotiating the price. I should start with a strong opening offer close to the listing price to anchor the negotiation and signal the item's value. I'll also highlight the monitor's premium features to justify the price.

**Code:**
```py

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has proposed a price of $1399.99, which is $100 less than the listing price but still far above my bottom line of $1021.79. I need to anchor lower to create room for negotiation and aim to settle well below my bottom line. I'll counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation process.
