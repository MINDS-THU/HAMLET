Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I need to initiate the negotiation with a strong anchoring strategy by making a low initial offer. This will help establish my position as a buyer who seeks a favorable deal well below my bottomline.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has offered $300.0, which is below the listing price of $449.0, but above my bottomline of $106.55. I should counter with a higher offer to start a negotiation closer to the listing price and demonstrate the value of the iPad.
