Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I need to initiate the negotiation with a strong, low opening offer to establish room for negotiation. The initial listing price is $36.99, so I will start with an offer significantly below this to anchor the negotiations favorably for me. 

**Code:**
```py
# Initiating the negotiation with a low opening offer
initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=20.00, side_offer=None)
print(initial_offer)

# Wait for the seller's response to my initial offer

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The current offer from the buyer is $20, which provides a better utility than the bottomline price of $12.73. However, I should aim to maximize my utility by negotiating closer to the listing price of $36.99. A counteroffer could be a good step to see if the buyer is willing to increase their offer.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer to the buyer to negotiate a higher price.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=30.99, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for the buyer's response.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has come down significantly from the listing price of $36.99 to $30.99. Since my bottom line is $29.01, I still have room to negotiate. I should make a counteroffer slightly below $29.01 to see if the seller is willing to meet me closer to my target. This will maximize my utility.

**Code:**
```py
# Responding with a counteroffer below my bottom line to try and push for a better price
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=27.00, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to $27, which is getting closer to a satisfactory deal for me. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to increase my utility while staying reasonable. This counteroffer should aim to finalize the negotiation at the best possible price without risking losing the deal.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer to find a middle ground and maximize utility.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=29.99, side_offer=None)

======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has reduced the price to $29.99. Since my absolute maximum is $29.01, I'm close to reaching that limit. I should counter with a firm offer at $29.01, clearly indicating that it is my final offer and the maximum I can afford. This will maximize my utility while still giving me a chance to close the deal.

**Code:**
```py
# Making a firm final offer at my maximum limit
final_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=29.01, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer's new offer of $29.01 is very close to my counteroffer of $29.99. This is a favorable price that provides a good utility for me. Accepting this offer will conclude the negotiation successfully with a satisfactory deal.
