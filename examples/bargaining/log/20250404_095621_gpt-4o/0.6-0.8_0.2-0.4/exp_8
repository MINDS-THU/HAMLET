======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation as the buyer, I will start by making a strong low anchor offer. The listing price is $47.99, so I'll propose a significantly lower initial offer to leave room for negotiating upward if needed. This will help me secure a deal as far below my maximum acceptable price of $29.74 as possible.

Code:
```py
# Make an initial offer significantly below the listing price
initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=20.00, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer's offer of 20.0 is above my bottomline of 17.54, providing me a utility of 2.46 (20.0 - 17.54). While it is a positive utility, I aim to maximize my profit as a seller. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer close to the initial listing price to attempt to secure a better deal. A counteroffer will also signal that I am opening to negotiation. 

**Code:**
```py
# Respond with a counteroffer closer to the listing price to maximize utility.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=40.0, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer's new offer of 25.0 improves from their initial offer and provides a positive utility of 7.46. While this is better for the seller than their previous offer, my goal is to get as close to the listing price of 47.99 as possible.

I should counter once more with a price lower than my previous counteroffer to show some flexibility while still aiming for a favorable deal. 

**Code:**

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has reduced the price to $35.00. While this is a step in the right direction, it is still above my maximum price of $29.74. I need to counter once more, ideally just below my maximum to see if we can reach an agreement.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have sent a counteroffer of $29.00, which is near my maximum acceptable price. I'll wait for the seller's response to this offer, as their decision will guide my next moveâ€”either final acceptance, further negotiation, or potentially walking away if no agreement seems likely.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to 29.0, which provides a utility of 11.46. This improvement shows the buyer's willingness to come closer to my asking price. However, there is still room to potentially increase utility further.

I could make another slight counteroffer to see if they are willing to go higher. Given their willingness to move up, I'll propose a price slightly higher than their latest offer to inch closer to the target.
