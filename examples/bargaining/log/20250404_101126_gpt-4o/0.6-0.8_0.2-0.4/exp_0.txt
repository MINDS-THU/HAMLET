Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** To initiate the negotiation, I should start with a strong and assertive opening. My goal is to propose a low initial offer to establish leverage and leave room for future concessions. I will mention my budget constraints and competition to set a foundation for my offer.

**Code:**
```py
# Introduce myself and initiate negotiation with a low initial offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the Crucial RAM 32GB kit you have listed. I noticed the price is $100.99, but I'm working within a strict budget. Would you consider an offer of $50? I've seen similar items priced lower elsewhere.")

Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer has offered $50, which is below my lowest acceptable price of $24.76. I should make a counteroffer closer to the listing price to create room for negotiation. I'll also emphasize the quality and uniqueness of the product to justify the price.

Thought: I will make a counteroffer closer to the listing price and highlight the product's quality to encourage the buyer to consider a higher price.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has come down from their initial listing price of $100.99 to $90.99. Though this is a notable concession, the price is still well above my target. To maximize my utility, I should counter with a higher offer than initially proposed but lower than $90.99. This signals willingness to negotiate without approaching my budget ceiling yet.
