Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! Let's begin by initiating the negotiation with a message that expresses interest in the product and readiness to discuss the terms. This will set the stage for potential negotiation of the price.

**Thought:** Start the negotiation by expressing interest and opening the conversation for negotiation. 

**Code:**
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi! I'm interested in purchasing 'Flash, The (Blu-Ray + Digital)'. Could we discuss the price?")

Output message of the LLM:
I have sent the initial message to express interest in purchasing the item and to open the discussion on the price. Now, I'll wait for a response from the seller before proceeding with the next steps.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! My goal as the seller is to start with a strong and assertive offer, leveraging the item's features and scarcity to justify the price.

**Thought:** I will respond to the buyer, emphasizing the value and uniqueness of “Flash, The (Blu-Ray + Digital)” due to its bonus content and entertainment quality. I’ll then make an initial offer slightly above my listing price to anchor the negotiation positively in my favor.

**Code:**
```py
# Send a message to highlight the unique features of the item and make an initial offer.
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! 'Flash, The (Blu-Ray + Digital)' is a fantastic choice, complete with exclusive bonus content. It's a premium item in high demand, so I'm currently listing it at $39.98. Would you consider starting around that mark?")
print(message)

# Making an initial offer above the listing price to anchor high.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=41.50, side_offer="Includes a special digital bonus.")

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has provided an initial offer of $41.5, which is above both the listing price and my maximum budget, so it's unsuitable for consideration. Now I need to counter with a stronger, lower offer to steer the negotiation towards a more favorable price.

**Thought:** Counter with an offer that reflects a strategic starting point lower than the listing price to open up room for negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
# Aiming to propose a lower offer to open the negotiation
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=25.00, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
I have made a counteroffer of $25.00 without any additional incentives. Now I'll wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to negotiate closer to this price or to offer an alternative.

**Code:**
```py

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $25.00 is quite below my listing price and my ideal range, but there's still room to negotiate as it is above my bottom line of $10.82.

**Thought:** I will counter the buyer's offer with a price that is lower than my original offer but still significantly above their proposal. I want to move this negotiation towards a middle ground while conveying the item's unique value.

**Code:**
```py
# Counter the buyer's offer with a more favorable price.
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=35.00, side_offer="This item includes exclusive bonus digital content that enhances its value.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has revised the offer to $35.00, which is still above my maximum budget of $31.83. However, they emphasize the value-added with exclusive digital content.

**Thought:** I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my last, showing willingness to move slightly towards their range, but still maintaining below my maximum budget. This signals flexibility while keeping my utility in mind.

**Code:**
```py
# Propose a slightly higher offer to keep the conversation going
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=28.00, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
I have proposed a new offer of $28.00 to the seller, aiming to keep the negotiation process active without exceeding my budget constraints. Now, I'll wait to see how the seller responds.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer to $28.00, showing some flexibility. I need to make a counteroffer that further narrows the gap while emphasizing the item's quality and scarcity to maintain leverage.

**Thought:** I'll propose a new price slightly below my last counteroffer to encourage the buyer to meet me closer to my target, while still preserving room for good utility.

**Code:**
```py
# Counter with a slightly lower offer to narrow the negotiation gap while emphasizing the item's value.
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=32.00, side_offer="Thanks for your interest. This edition comes with rare bonus content which is a great value addition.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has come down to $32.00, which is just slightly above my bottom line. This is much closer to an acceptable price, though ideally, I'd like to secure a deal that allows for some utility.

**Thought:** Counter with an offer that is very near to my maximum budget to see if there is any room for a final minor adjustment below $31.83 that both of us can agree on.

**Code:**
```py
# Propose a final offer just under the maximum budget to close the deal, showing maximum flexibility.

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
I have made a counteroffer of $31.00, which is just under my maximum budget. This should reflect my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price while maintaining some utility.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $31.00 is getting closer to my last counteroffer of $32.00. This demonstrates their willingness to negotiate towards a middle ground.

**Thought:** Given that the buyer has shown flexibility and we're near the middle, it's sensible to accept this offer. This ensures a good utility while closing the deal efficiently.
