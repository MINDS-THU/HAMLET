**Thought:** To start the negotiation process, I will send a message to express interest in the Barbie DreamHouse and suggest that I'm looking to negotiate. Following this, I will make an initial offer well below the listing price to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Let's aim to start the offer around $100.

**Code:**
```py
# Send an initial message to the seller expressing interest.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi! I'm interested in the Barbie DreamHouse. Are you open to negotiating the price?")
print(message)

# Make an initial offer significantly below the listing price to establish my anchor.

Given that the buyer's offer of $100 is significantly below both the listing price and my bottom line of $49.52, I need to counter with a more favorable offer. My strategy will be to start high and gradually make concessions, signaling value and scarcity to encourage the buyer to increase their offer.

**Thought:** I will counter with an offer slightly below the listing price to anchor the negotiation higher, ensuring I have room to make concessions. I will also highlight the value and popularity of the Barbie DreamHouse to justify the price.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counter offer to the buyer with a higher price and highlight the item's features and demand.
counter_offer_price = 219.99
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the Barbie DreamHouse. This is a very popular item and it offers tremendous value with its features and accessories. Given its demand, I can offer it to you for $219.99.")
