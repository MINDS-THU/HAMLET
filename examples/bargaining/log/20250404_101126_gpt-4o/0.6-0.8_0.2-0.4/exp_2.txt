Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, I should initiate the negotiation with a strong and low opening offer to anchor the price in my favor. I will propose a price significantly below my bottomline and listing price to create room for negotiation. Additionally, I should express interest in the item to establish a positive negotiation tone.
