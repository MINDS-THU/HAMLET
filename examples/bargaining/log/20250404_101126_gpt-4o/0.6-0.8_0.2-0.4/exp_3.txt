Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, my goal is to secure the Melissa & Doug Wooden Scoop and Serve Ice Cream Counter at the lowest possible price. I will start with a low initial offer to anchor the negotiation firmly on the buyerâ€™s side. This will give me room to make concessions if needed and maximize my utility. I'll begin by introducing myself and expressing my interest in the item to set a polite tone for negotiations.
