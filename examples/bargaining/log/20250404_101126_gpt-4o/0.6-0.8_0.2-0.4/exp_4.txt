Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As a buyer, I should start with a low initial offer to establish negotiation leverage and leave room for concessions. I will open well below the seller's listing price to give myself flexibility to negotiate upwards if necessary.

# Making an initial offer well below the listing price to establish negotiation leverage.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=30, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has proposed a price of $30, which is below the listing price of $59.99 but still higher than my bottom line of $17.58. While this isn't a bad offer, I can still try to negotiate a higher price. I can counter with a price closer to the listing price to leave room for negotiation while emphasizing the value and quality of the product to justify a higher cost.
