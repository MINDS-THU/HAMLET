As a buyer, I want to start the negotiation by expressing interest but anchoring my initial offer well below the listing price to leave plenty of room for concessions. This will establish my position and set the stage for negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
Before proceeding with my counteroffer, I'll assess the situation. The buyer has proposed $200, which is considerably below the listing price of $349.99. My task is to negotiate a better price, ideally closer to the listing price, while ensuring it remains above my minimum acceptable price of $94.38. I'll start with a counteroffer slightly below the listing price to anchor higher.

**Thought:** I will send a message explaining the excellent features and quality of the Nintendo Switch OLED model to justify its high value. Then, I'll make a counteroffer at $325, which is still significantly lower than the listing price to encourage the buyer for negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
# Sending a message to justify the product's high value
