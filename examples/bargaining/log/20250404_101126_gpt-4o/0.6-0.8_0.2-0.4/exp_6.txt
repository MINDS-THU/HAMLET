======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I need to start the negotiation by making an initial low offer to set an anchor for the discussion. This establishes leverage and gives me room to make concessions later. Since the seller's asking price is $299, I'll begin with an assertive offer well below this. I'll offer $150 to start the negotiation.

```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=150, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has offered \$150, which is significantly below my initial listing price of \$299 but above my bottom line of \$103.24. My primary goal is to secure the highest possible utility. I should counter offer with a price closer to my listing price to initiate the negotiation process and hopefully reach a middle ground that maximizes my utility.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has countered with an offer of $275. Since my bottomline is $229.04, I have some room to negotiate below this figure. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my bottomline to see if the seller is willing to lower the price further. I'll propose $200 as my next offer.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to \$200, indicating some flexibility on their part. However, this is still below my counteroffer of \$275. To maximize my utility, I should make a counteroffer that is closer to the buyer's recent offer but still higher than \$200, to move us closer to a mutually agreeable price.
