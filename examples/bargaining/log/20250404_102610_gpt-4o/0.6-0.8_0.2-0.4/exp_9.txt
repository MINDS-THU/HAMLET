Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As a buyer, I should start with a low offer to anchor the negotiation and provide room for potential concessions. The seller is likely expecting negotiations to start below market value, so I'll need to justify my initial offer by mentioning budget constraints or alternative options. This will help set the stage for the negotiation in my favor. 

**Code:**
```py
# Starting the negotiation with a low initial offer
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=80, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```

======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've made an initial low offer of $80 to the seller. Now, I should wait for the seller's response to see how they react to my offer. This will help me gauge their willingness to negotiate and potentially adjust my strategy based on their response.

**Code:**
```py
# Waiting for the seller's response to my offer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
# Waiting for the seller's response to my offer

print(response)
======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer's initial offer of 80 is above my bottomline of 50.87, giving me a positive utility. However, my goal is to maximize my utility, so I should counter with a higher price to leave room for negotiations. 

**Code:**
```py
# Counteroffer with a higher price to maximize utility and leave room for further negotiation.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=120, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```
======== seller ========

======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have made a counteroffer of 120. Now I need to wait for the buyer's response to my offer. This will allow me to see how flexible the buyer is in terms of pricing and adjust my strategy accordingly.

**Code:**
```py
# Wait for the buyer's response to my counteroffer.
wait = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")
print(wait)

======== seller ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has proposed an offer of $120, which is below my maximum threshold of $127.69 but still higher than I would like to pay. To secure a better deal, I should counter this offer slightly lower, indicating willingness to negotiate but still emphasizing my budget constraint. This time, I'll also mention alternatives to motivate them to lower the price further.

**Code:**
```py
# Making a counteroffer with a slightly higher price than my initial offer
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=100, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)

Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have made a counteroffer of $100 to the seller, which is a slight increase from my initial offer. Now, I should wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to accept this offer or propose another counteroffer.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to 100, which is still above my bottomline and provides a positive utility. I can try to maximize my utility by proposing a slight decrease from my previous counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a higher price.

**Code:**
```py
# Propose a slightly lower price from my previous offer to encourage agreement while maximizing utility.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=110, side_offer=None)

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has responded with a new offer of $110, which is closer to my previous counteroffer of $100. This indicates they are open to negotiating further. To try securing an even better deal, I'll propose a slightly lower price while reiterating my budget constraints. We are inching closer to a possible agreement, so I'll fine-tune my offer to show willingness to find a middle ground.

**Code:**
```py
# Making a further counteroffer to move closer to my budget limit
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=105, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've sent a counteroffer of $105, aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offers and the seller's proposal. Now, I'll wait for the seller's response to see if they accept this offer or make another counteroffer.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has now increased their offer to 105. This is close to my counteroffer of 110, and it's still above my bottomline, leaving a good margin for utility. I can accept this offer to ensure a sale while securing a favorable outcome.
