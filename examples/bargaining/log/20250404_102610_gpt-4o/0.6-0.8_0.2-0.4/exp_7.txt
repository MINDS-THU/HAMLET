Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! It's crucial to start with a strong and strategic initial offer. Let's aim for a price that provides room for negotiation while also considering the quality and popularity of the sweater.

**Thought:** I will propose a price that is higher than the bottomline to leave room for negotiation but still remains attractive given the itemâ€™s quality and popularity. The initial price should reflect the sweater's value as a unique and popular item. Given that it's a popular style, I want to signal that the demand is high.

**Code:**
```py
# I will make an initial offer with a price that reflects the item's uniqueness and demand.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=120, side_offer=None)

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has offered a price of $120. This is below my bottomline of $163.25, but I should try to negotiate further to maximize my utility. I will make a counter-offer to anchor the negotiation lower and see if the seller is willing to move their price.

Code:

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has proposed a counteroffer of $100. My goal is to maximize utility while finding a mutually agreeable price.

**Thought:** The buyer's offer of $100 is below my initial offer but still above my bottomline of $71.46. I will make a counteroffer closer to my initial price to indicate the item's value and attempt to anchor at a higher price.
