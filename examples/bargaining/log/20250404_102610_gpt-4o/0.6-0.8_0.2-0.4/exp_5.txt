Output message of the LLM:
### I've been tasked to initiate negotiations. 

**Thought:** I need to start the negotiation by expressing interest in the product and asking for the seller's starting price. This will allow me to anchor my initial offer based on their proposed price while ensuring that I maintain the flexibility to negotiate downwards from my maximum utility point.

**Code:**
```py
# Send an initial message to the seller expressing interest and asking for the starting price.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the WD 12TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive. Could you please let me know your starting price?")
