Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! I'll begin the negotiation process by sending a message to express interest and establish the initial communication. This will also give me an idea of where the seller stands in terms of pricing.

**Thought:** Introduce myself as a potential buyer and ask for the seller's starting price. This will help me gauge the negotiation space and plan my strategy accordingly.

**Code:**
```py
# Send an introductory message to the seller to initiate negotiation
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in the INTEX 58332EP Explorer 300 Inflatable Boat Set. Could you let me know your starting price?")
print(message)

Step 2

Output message of the LLM:
I've successfully sent the message to the seller inquiring about their starting price for the inflatable boat set. Now, I will wait for their response to this message.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I'll start by making an initial offer above my bottomline to leave room for negotiation. This way, I can maximize my utility by starting with a higher price point. Given my bottomline is 17.8, I'll start with a reasonable yet profitable price of 25.0.

**Code:**
```py
# Making an offer at a price that maximizes utility while allowing room for negotiation
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=25.0, side_offer=None)

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has made an initial offer with a price of 25.0. This offer is well below my bottomline of 35.61, which means there is still room for negotiation to maximize my utility further.

**Thought:** Since the seller's initial offer is already below my bottomline, I'll propose a counter-offer lower than their offer to create room for further concessions. This will test the seller's flexibility and aim to decrease the price further.

**Code:**
```py
# Propose a lower counter-offer to maximize utility
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=20.0, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has proposed a price of 20.0, which is above my bottomline of 17.8, providing positive utility. However, there's still room to negotiate a better deal. To maximize my utility, I'll counter with a slightly reduced offer, signaling willingness to negotiate while aiming for a higher price.

**Code:**
```py
# Making a counteroffer close to the buyer's proposal but slightly higher to increase my utility
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=22.5, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has countered with a price of 22.5. This is still well below my bottomline and offers a good deal for me, but I want to maximize my utility even further.

**Thought:** Since the seller is willing to negotiate, I'll propose another counter-offer slightly lower than their current offer to leverage my position further. This way, I can see how much more I can reduce the price.

**Thought:** The buyer has proposed a new offer of 21.0. This price is above my bottomline and would provide a positive utility. Although I aimed for a higher price, the negotiation has shown a trend that may not reach my counter offer of 22.5. Accepting 21.0 is still a profitable decision.
