Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, I need to initiate the negotiation with a strong opening offer that establishes a low anchor point. I'll aim to start significantly below my bottomline price of 191.2 to allow room for negotiation. A good starting offer could be around 120. 

**Code:**
```py
# Initiating the negotiation with a low anchor offer
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=120, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Waiting for a response from the seller
wait = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(wait)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has made an offer of $120. This is above my bottom line of $86.99, so it results in a positive utility. However, my goal is to maximize my utility, so I should counteroffer with a higher price that still leaves room for negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
# Counteroffer with a price above the buyer's offer but below the initial asking price to leave room for negotiation while maximizing utility.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=145, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has countered with an offer of 145, which is better than my initial offer but still allows me some room to negotiate further downward. I want to maximize my utility while moving towards a deal. I will counter with an offer of 130, indicating willingness to move closer to their offer but still maintaining pressure to come down further.

**Code:**
```py
# Making a counteroffer below the seller's current offer to maximize utility
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=130, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to $130, indicating a willingness to negotiate further. While this is below my counteroffer, it is still above my bottom line. I should attempt another counteroffer that seeks a better utility while not deterring the buyer.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has reduced the price to 140. While this is closer to our preferred range, I can try to further negotiate the price. I will make another counteroffer, slightly increasing my previous offer to 135, to show good faith negotiation while still ensuring a better deal for myself.

# Making another counteroffer slightly higher than the previous to show willingness to negotiate

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has made another counteroffer of $135, which is close to my recent offer. This indicates a strong interest in closing the deal. I'll make a final slight adjustment to signal that I'm reaching my limit and to attempt to close the deal favorably.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has come down to 138, which indicates they are willing to negotiate further. Considering that I am getting closer to a desirable price, I should decide if I should push for a slightly lower offer or accept this. Given the progression, 138 appears to be a fair compromise, providing good utility compared to the bottomline of 191.2. Accepting this offer would maximize my utility under the current negotiation circumstances without risking the seller pulling back or walking away.
