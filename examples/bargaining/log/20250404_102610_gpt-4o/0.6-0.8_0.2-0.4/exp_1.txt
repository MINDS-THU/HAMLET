======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As a buyer, I'm going to initiate the negotiation with a low initial offer to establish leverage. This will give me room to adjust and negotiate towards a price well below my bottomline.

**Thought:** I should start with a low offer to establish a strong negotiation position. I'll introduce my interest in the LEGO Architecture London Skyline Collection and propose an initial offer.

**Code:**
```py
# Send an initial message to introduce my interest and make a low initial offer.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in buying the LEGO Architecture London Skyline Collection. I'd like to start negotiations with an offer of $20.00.")

I've initiated the negotiation by sending an initial offer of $20.00 for the LEGO Architecture London Skyline Collection. Now, I'll wait for the seller's response to proceed with the negotiation strategy.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's initial offer of $20.00 provides me with a utility of $4.11 ($20.00 - $15.89), which is acceptable but not optimal for maximizing my utility. I will counter with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while achieving a better outcome.

Thought: I will propose a counteroffer at a higher price, starting at $30.00, to open room for negotiation and aim for a better utility. Additionally, I will emphasize the uniqueness and value of the product to justify the price.

Code:
```py
# Make a counteroffer at $30.00, highlighting the value and popularity of the item
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=30.00, side_offer="This set is quite popular for its architectural details, making it a valuable addition to any collection.")

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has made a counteroffer of $30.00 with a side note emphasizing the set's popularity and architectural value. This offer is below my bottomline of $31.04, but I'll aim to negotiate further to get the best possible deal.

**Thought:** I should counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one but still below the seller's price, showing willingness to negotiate while attempting to land a better deal.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer in response to the seller's proposal.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=25.00, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's counteroffer of $25.00 provides me with a utility of $9.11 ($25.00 - $15.89). While this offer is fairly reasonable and improves my utility from their initial offer, there might still be room for further negotiation.

Thought: I will counter again with a slightly higher price to try for better utility, while acknowledging their interest and flexibility. This signal might prompt them to reconsider and possibly increase their offer further.

Code:
```py
# Countering with an offer of $28.00, highlighting the collectible value of the set
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=28.00, side_offer="This collectible set has high demand, making it a worthwhile investment.")

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has countered with a price of $28.00, mentioning the set's high demand. This is a reasonable move closer to my offer, and it's still below my bottomline. However, it's important to try to optimize the price further for maximum utility.

**Thought:** A small additional concession might still be possible. I'll make another counteroffer to see if the seller is willing to accept a slightly lower price.

**Code:**
```py
# Send another counteroffer slightly lower than the seller's current offer.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=26.50, side_offer=None)

I've made a further counteroffer of $26.50. This represents a strategic attempt to lower the final price while still showing flexibility. I'll wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to accept this offer or if further negotiation is necessary.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's latest offer of $26.5 provides me with a utility of $10.61 ($26.5 - $15.89), which is quite favorable. However, before making a final decision, I want to ensure that I have reached the best possible outcome. There may be room for a minor increase, so I will try to counter one more time, while being aware of not losing the deal.

Thought: I will counter with a slight decrease in the requested price to $27.00, indicating that this is an excellent deal for such a unique and detailed set. If the buyer resists further, I can consider accepting their current offer in subsequent rounds.

Code:
```py
# Countering with an offer of $27.00, emphasizing the excellent value at this price
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=27.00, side_offer="At $27.00, this detailed set is an excellent deal for any LEGO enthusiast.")
