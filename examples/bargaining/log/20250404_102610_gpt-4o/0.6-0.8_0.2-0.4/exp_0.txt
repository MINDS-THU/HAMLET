Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, I aim to start the negotiation by anchoring low to give myself maximum negotiation space. This opening offer should signal that I am serious but constrained by my budget.

```py
# Send a message to express interest in the item and make an initial low offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there, I'm very interested in purchasing the Samsung 65-Inch OLED. Considering my budget, I'm prepared to offer $900 to start. Could you let me know your thoughts?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Given the buyer's initial offer of $900, it's important to respond assertively with a counteroffer that provides room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit. I'll start with a higher price to anchor the negotiation positively for the seller. 

**Thought:** I will counter the buyer's offer with a price significantly above my bottomline to leave room for negotiation. I will also highlight the unique features and high demand for the TV to justify the pricing.

**Code:**
```py
# Sending a counteroffer with justification
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the Samsung 65-Inch OLED. This model is in high demand due to its cutting-edge features like Quantum HDR and Dolby Atmos. Given these features, I'm offering it to you at $1,200. Let me know your thoughts!")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller's offer of $1,200 is significantly above my opening bid but is still below my bottomline. I should counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial to show willingness to move closer to their price but still maintain room for negotiation.

# Counter offer with a price that is slightly higher than my initial offer

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer to $1000, which shows their willingness to move closer to my desired price. To maximize my utility while keeping the negotiation moving forward, I'll counter with a slightly higher price than their offer, aiming to reach a middle ground. At the same time, I'll emphasize the premium features of the TV to justify this price point.

**Thought:** I will counter with a price that is closer to the buyer's latest offer while emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.

**Code:**
