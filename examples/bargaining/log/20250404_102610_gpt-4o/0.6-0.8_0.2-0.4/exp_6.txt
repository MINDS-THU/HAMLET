Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I need to start the negotiation with a low opening offer to ensure there's room to improve my utility during the negotiation process. This will set the stage for the negotiation and potentially anchor the seller's expectations lower.

Code:
```py
# Send a message to initiate the negotiation with a low offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the Sony UBP-X700M 4K Blu-ray player. Given my budget constraints, I would like to start with an offer of $150. Could you consider this offer?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Given the buyer's initial offer of $150, it is significantly above my bottomline of $78.23, which gives me an opportunity to negotiate further to maximize my utility. However, I'll need to increase the offer to a more profitable level for me.

**Thought:** I will make a counteroffer that is above the buyer's initial offer but leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer should demonstrate the product's value while signaling that I am open to negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer above the buyer's initial offer.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=200, side_offer="Free shipping")
print(offer)

# Wait for the buyer's response to allow them to consider my counteroffer.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with an offer of $200, including free shipping. This price is above my bottom line, but I cannot afford it given my constraints. I need to counter with a price lower than my initial offer. However, I can highlight that my budget constraints limit me and attempt to negotiate for a lower price that remains favorable.

Code:
```py
# Respond to the seller's counter offer with a slightly higher offer than my initial to show flexibility, and suggest a price of $165.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=165, side_offer=None)
send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I appreciate the offer of free shipping, but $200 is beyond my budget. How about $165? I'm committed to making the purchase today if we can agree.")

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer to $165, which is still significantly above my bottomline of $78.23. However, I want to ensure I maximize my utility without pushing the buyer away.

**Thought:** I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than the buyer's last offer to gain better utility but still keep within a range that could likely be accepted by the buyer.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a slightly higher counteroffer to maximize utility while maintaining the buyer's interest.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=180, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has lowered their offer to $180, which is closer to my limit but still allows some room to improve my utility. I will attempt to negotiate a bit more to see if I can secure a better deal, perhaps by pointing out my budget constraints again.

Code:
```py
# Make a slightly higher counteroffer of $170, emphasizing my budget constraints
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=170, side_offer=None)
