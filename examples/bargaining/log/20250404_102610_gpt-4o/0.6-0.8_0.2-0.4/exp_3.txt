Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As the buyer, my strategy will include starting with a low initial offer to establish a strong negotiation position. I’ll need to ensure that the offer is significantly below my bottomline to allow room for negotiations. I will also communicate budget constraints to support my offer.

Code:
```py
# Initiating the negotiation with a low initial offer to establish a strong position.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=15.00, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Sending a message to express interest and establish a budget constraint context.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi! I'm interested in this Pokémon Carry Case Playset but need to stay within a tight budget. Can we discuss a reasonable price?")
print(message)

# Waiting for a response from the seller before deciding the next step.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer has offered a price of $15.00, which is above my bottomline of $11.73. Therefore, this offer is acceptable, but I want to ensure I maximize my utility by attempting to negotiate for a slightly higher price.

**Thought:** I should make a counteroffer slightly above $15.00, using scarcity and product uniqueness as leverage, to attempt increasing my utility while keeping the buyer engaged.

**Code:**

```py
# Send a message to the buyer highlighting the product's unique features and make a counteroffer.
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hi! Thanks for your offer. The Pokémon Carry Case Playset is a fantastic and unique product, popular with many fans. Given its features and demand, how about $17.50? It would be a great deal for such an iconic playset.")

Thought: The seller has come back with a price of $17.50, which is closer to my maximum budget than I initially offered, but there is still room to negotiate. I should provide some feedback to further negotiate the price down. I’ll counter with $16.00, while reinforcing the budget constraints and suggesting there are similar options available in the market.

Code:
```py
# Counter the seller's offer with a slightly higher price but still below my bottomline.

# Communicate my reasoning for a lower price based on budget constraints and alternative market options.
