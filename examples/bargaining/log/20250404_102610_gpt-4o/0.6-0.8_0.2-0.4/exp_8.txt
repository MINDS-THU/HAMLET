Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As the buyer, I want to start by expressing interest in the item and subtly hinting at a budget constraint. This can set the stage for the seller to consider a competitive offer from the start. I will then make an initial low offer to create space for negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Introduce interest in the item and check the seller’s initial offer.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in purchasing the Arkham Horror Dunwich Legacy Campaign Expansion. Could you let me know your starting price?")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=50.00, side_offer=None)
