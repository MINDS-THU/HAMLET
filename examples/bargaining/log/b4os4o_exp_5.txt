Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is interested in negotiating the price, which gives me an opportunity to engage and potentially secure a favorable deal slightly lower than the listing price. I'll respond positively to keep the conversation going and make an initial offer close to the listing price to start the negotiation. This initial offer will not be too low, keeping room for later concessions if necessary.

Code:
```py
# Sending a positive message and making an initial offer close to the listing price
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! I'm glad to hear you're interested. Certainly, I'm open to negotiating the price.")
print(message)

# Making an initial offer slightly lower than the listing price

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has made a counteroffer at $27.0, while asking to continue the free shipping offer. This is slightly below my initial offer but still remains above my bottomline price. I can make a counteroffer slightly higher than their offer to see if we can meet closer to my preference while maintaining the free shipping to keep them interested.

Code:

Thought: The seller has countered with a price of $27.50 while maintaining the free shipping offer. This new offer is reasonable and still below my maximum acceptable price of $28.38. Accepting this offer would result in a good utility for me, so it might be wise to agree to this deal.
