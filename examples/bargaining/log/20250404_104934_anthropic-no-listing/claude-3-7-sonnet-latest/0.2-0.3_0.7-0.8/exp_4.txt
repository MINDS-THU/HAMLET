I'll initiate the negotiation as a buyer for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite, aiming to secure a price well below my maximum budget of $88.68.

Thought: As a buyer, I should start with a low initial offer to establish negotiation leverage. Based on the product being a tablet, I'll research typical market prices first to have some context for my opening offer. Then I'll open with a price significantly below my maximum budget.

Thought: Now I have a better understanding of the market prices for this Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite. Based on the search results, I can see that the tablet is selling for around $200-$268 at various retailers. Since my maximum budget is $88.68, I need to start with a much lower initial offer and work my way up strategically. I'll open with an offer around $50, which is intentionally low but will give me negotiation room.

I need to firmly but politely reject this offer and counter with a more reasonable price, while maintaining my leverage.

Thought: The buyer has only increased their offer by $10 to $85, which is still far below my bottomline of $279.71. We are too far apart in our price expectations. While I want to make a sale, accepting anything below my bottomline would result in negative utility for me. I should clearly communicate that we're too far apart to reach a deal, explain my constraints, and make a final counter-offer that's still above my bottomline but shows significant movement from my initial price. I'll try $289.99 as my "final offer" to see if they'll make a substantial move.
