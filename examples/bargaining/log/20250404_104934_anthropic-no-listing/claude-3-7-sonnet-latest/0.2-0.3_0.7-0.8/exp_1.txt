Output message of the LLM:
I'll now engage in the negotiation as a buyer looking to purchase the Sargent Art 120 Piece colored pencil set. My goal is to secure a price well below my maximum limit of $4.74 to maximize my utility.

Thought: As a buyer, I want to start with a low initial offer to establish negotiation leverage. Since my maximum is $4.74, I'll start significantly lower - around $2.00, which gives me plenty of room to negotiate upward if needed. I'll begin by showing interest in the product and asking for the seller's starting price before making my initial offer.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the Sargent Art 120 Piece Colored Pencils set. It looks like a nice product. What price are you asking for it?")
print(message)

Thought: I'm the seller of the Sargent Art 120 Piece Colored Pencils set. The buyer has initiated contact and asked about my price. My bottomline is $17.64, which means I cannot accept any price below this amount. I should start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation. For a 120-piece colored pencil set with 56 colors including specialty colors like gold and silver, I'll start with a price of around $34.99, which gives me plenty of room to negotiate while still being a reasonable market price for such an art set.

Thought: Based on my search, I can see that the market price for this exact set varies significantly, but is much lower than the seller's asking price of $34.99. Walmart has it for $8.52 (down from $35.17), and Michaels has it for $17.86. I'll use this information to counter the seller's high initial offer.

Thought: The buyer has proposed an extremely low offer of $3.00, which is far below my bottomline of $17.64. They're claiming that Walmart sells the product for $8.52 and Michaels for $17.86. I need to:
1. Address their price comparison - even their own comparison shows prices much higher than their $3 offer
2. Reject their offer firmly as it's not even close to my bottomline
3. Counter with a more reasonable price, but still above my bottomline

I'll come down a bit from my initial offer but maintain that my product is worth more than the lowest prices they've mentioned. I'll counter with $25.99, which is a significant reduction from my initial price but still gives me room to negotiate further.

Thought: The seller has reduced their price to $18.99, which is still far above my maximum of $4.74. They're trying to add more value with additional items, but the price is the key factor for me. They've stated this is their absolute minimum, suggesting they won't go much lower. Since we're still so far apart, I need to make it clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement. I'll make one final offer at my absolute maximum of $4.70 (slightly below my $4.74 limit) and explain that I simply cannot go higher, and if that doesn't work, I'll need to look elsewhere.

Thought: The buyer has increased their offer slightly to $4.70, but this is still far below my bottomline of $17.64. They've made it clear that this is their absolute maximum budget. Unfortunately, accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me, leading to negative utility.

Since we appear to be at an impasse, and the gap between their maximum and my minimum is too large to bridge, I should politely decline their final offer and suggest they look for alternatives within their budget range. I'll maintain a professional tone and leave the door open for future business if their budget changes.
