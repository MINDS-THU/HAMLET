Thought: Based on my research, I can see that the Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse BD/DVD Combo + Digital is typically priced around $19.99 at retail (from Target listings), with some sales or variations depending on the retailer. Since my maximum budget is $7.38, I'll open with a significantly lower offer around $4.00, which gives me room to negotiate up while still staying below my maximum. This is a reasonable starting point since used copies or special promotions might be available at lower prices.

Thought: The buyer is still making very small incremental increases in their offers, now at $7.00, which remains far below my bottomline of $19.90. They're continuing to use emotional appeals about their student budget, but also adding incentives like being a potential return customer.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has rejected my final offer and has chosen to quit the negotiation. They maintained their minimum price of $19.90, which was far above my maximum budget of $7.38. Since no deal was reached, my utility is zero. I'll acknowledge the end of the negotiation and provide a final response.

Code:
```py
# Acknowledge the end of negotiation with a polite message
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I understand your position and appreciate your time and consideration during our negotiation. Thank you for being respectful and patient. Unfortunately, we couldn't reach an agreement that works for both of us, which I completely understand. I wish you the best with finding a buyer who can meet your price point. Take care!")
print(message)

# Provide final answer summarizing the negotiation outcome
final_answer(answer="The negotiation ended without a deal. The seller's minimum acceptable price was $19.90, which was well above my maximum budget of $7.38. Despite multiple rounds of negotiation and offers (starting at $4.00 and eventually reaching my near-maximum of $7.35), we couldn't bridge the significant gap between our positions. Since no deal was reached, my utility is zero.")
