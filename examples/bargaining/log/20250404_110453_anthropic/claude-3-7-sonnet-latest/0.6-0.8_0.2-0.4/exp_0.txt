I'll initiate the negotiation as the buyer for the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus, aiming to secure a price well below my maximum budget of $145.56.

Thought: As a buyer, I should start with a strong anchor point that's significantly below the listing price of $199.99. A good opening strategy would be to offer around 60-65% of the asking price, which gives me plenty of room to negotiate upward while still trying to secure a deal that maximizes my utility. I'll also research comparable prices to strengthen my position.

Thought: Great! I found some valuable pricing information through the search. I see that the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus has been on sale at various retailers for much lower than the listing price:
- Amazon had it for $119 during Black Friday (down from $199)
- Tom's Guide mentioned it at $139 (down from $199)

This gives me strong leverage for negotiation. I'll start with an offer around $110, which is lower than these sale prices but gives me room to negotiate upward. I'll mention these sale prices in my opening message to justify my lower initial offer.

Code:
```py
# Initiate negotiation with a message and opening offer
initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus. I've been researching prices and have seen this exact model on sale at major retailers like Amazon for as low as $119-$139 recently. Would you consider $110 for this item? I can pay immediately.")

Thought: The seller has come down to $148, which is still above my maximum budget of $145.56, but just by a small amount ($2.44). Given how close we are, I'll make one final counter-offer at $145, which is just below my maximum and would give me a small positive utility. If they don't accept this, I may need to walk away from the deal.

Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $145 with immediate payment, social media recommendation, and a detailed product review. This would give me a utility of $145 - $74.39 = $70.61, which is quite good compared to their previous offers. We're getting very close now, with only a $3 difference between our offers. The buyer claims this is their absolute final offer and that they've reached their budget limit. Given how close we are, and considering the added value of a detailed product review (which could help with future sales), I think it makes sense to accept this offer rather than risk losing the deal over just $3.

Thought: Great news! The seller has accepted my final offer of $145, which is below my maximum budget of $145.56. This gives me a small positive utility of $0.56 ($145.56 - $145.00). While the utility is small, it's positive, and I've successfully negotiated down from the initial asking price of $199.99 to $145, which is a significant discount of $54.99 (or about 27.5%). I should now finalize the agreement and express appreciation to the seller.
