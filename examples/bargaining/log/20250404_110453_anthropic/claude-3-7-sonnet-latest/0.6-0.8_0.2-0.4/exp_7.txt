Output message of the LLM:
I'll initiate this negotiation as a buyer for the Nintendo Switch OLED Model. My goal is to secure a price well below my maximum limit of $225.04 to maximize my utility.

Thought: I'll start with a friendly introduction and make a low initial offer to establish my anchor point. Since the listing price is $349.99, I'll open with an offer around 50-60% of that price, which would be approximately $175. This gives me plenty of room to negotiate upward while still staying well below my maximum.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in the Nintendo Switch OLED Model you're selling. I've been looking at several options and comparing prices. Would you be open to negotiating on the price?")
print(message)

Thought: I'm the seller of a Nintendo Switch OLED Model with a listing price of $349.99. My bottom line is $121.26, which means I cannot accept any offer below that amount. The buyer has opened with a polite message expressing interest and asking if I'm open to negotiation. This is a good opportunity to establish a positive tone while maintaining a strong position as the seller.

I should be friendly but firm in my initial response, emphasizing the quality and value of the item. I'll acknowledge that I'm open to reasonable offers, but I'll maintain a position close to my listing price to leave room for negotiation. Since I want to maximize my utility (Deal Price - $121.26), I should start high and concede slowly.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thanks for your interest in the Nintendo Switch OLED Model. It's in excellent condition and includes everything in the original packaging. This is the latest model with the improved 7-inch OLED screen, enhanced audio, and 64GB of storage. While I'm open to reasonable offers, I should mention that I've had several inquiries about it already. What price were you thinking?")

However, I should counter with a higher price since this is the first offer and there's significant room for negotiation.

Thought: The buyer claims to have made a previous offer of $220, but I don't recall seeing that specific offer in our conversation. Regardless, they're now offering $225 as their "absolute final offer" with immediate payment. They've rejected my offer of $240 with various extras.

Let me calculate my utility if I accept their offer of $225:
Utility = $225 - $121.26 = $103.74

This is significantly above my minimum utility of zero (no deal), so accepting would be better than walking away. However, I can try one final counter to see if they'll meet me closer to the middle, at $230. If they reject this, I'll likely accept their $225 offer since it still gives me good utility.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for clarifying your offer. I don't recall seeing the $220 offer specifically in our conversation, but I appreciate you being upfront about your maximum budget now. Your offer of $225 is very close to what I can accept. I've come down substantially from my initial price, and I'd like to meet you halfway between your $225 and my $240. Could you do $230 with all the extras I mentioned?

Thought: The buyer has firmly stated that $225 is their absolute maximum budget, and they cannot go to $230. They've rejected my counteroffer but are still willing to purchase at $225 with immediate payment. 

Let me calculate my utility one more time:
Utility at $225 = $225 - $121.26 = $103.74

This is a good utility for me, significantly above my minimum acceptable level. The difference between $225 and $230 is only $5, which is a small amount relative to the total deal value. The buyer seems genuinely at their limit, and they've been polite and engaged throughout the negotiation. I've already brought my price down significantly from my initial listing of $349.99, and I've been offering additional items to sweeten the deal.

At this point, I believe accepting their offer of $225 is the best decision to maximize my utility while ensuring the sale goes through.
