Output message of the LLM:
I'll begin negotiating as the buyer for the MacBook Air. I need to secure a price well below my maximum budget of $884.56 to maximize my utility.

Thought: As the buyer, I should start with a strong anchor well below the listing price. The laptop is listed at $1299, but I want to begin very low to establish negotiation leverage. I'll open with a friendly but assertive message and make an initial offer around 50-55% of the listing price to leave plenty of room for negotiation upward while still potentially ending well below my maximum.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in this MacBook Air. While the specs look good, I've been comparing prices across different retailers and have a strict budget I need to work within.")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=679, side_offer="I can pay immediately via secure payment")
print(offer)

response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has reaffirmed that $884 is absolutely their maximum budget. They've been consistent in gradually increasing their offers throughout our negotiation, which suggests they're being genuine about their budget constraints. This price of $884 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $274.60, giving me a utility of $609.40. While I tried for a slightly higher price, it seems the buyer has reached their limit, and I risk losing the sale if I push further. Given that this is a reasonable offer that's well above my bottom line, I'll accept their final offer of $884.

```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints and your persistence throughout our negotiation. You've been upfront about your limitations, and I value that. While I was hoping we could meet at $899, I understand that every dollar counts in your budget. Given that you've worked with me to reach this point and are ready to complete the purchase immediately, I'm willing to accept your offer of $884. I'll still include all the accessories we discussed - the laptop sleeve, USB-C hub, 2-year warranty, and expedited shipping. I believe this will be a fair deal for both of us.")

Thought: The seller has accepted my offer of $884, which is just under my maximum budget of $884.56. This gives me a small positive utility of $0.56 (calculated as 884.56 - 884). While the utility is minimal, it's still positive, and the deal includes significant added value with all the accessories (laptop sleeve, USB-C hub, 2-year warranty, and expedited shipping). I should acknowledge this acceptance and complete the transaction.

It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to receiving this excellent device!")
