Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start the negotiation by sending a message to express my interest in the product and make an initial offer. The initial offer will be strategically lower than the listing price but not too low as to offend the seller. 

Code:
```py
# Sending an initial message to express interest and make an initial offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in purchasing the DEWALT 20V MAX Cordless Wet-Dry Vacuum. Can we discuss the price?")
print(message)

# Making an initial offer lower than the listing price
initial_offer_price = 120  # This is an initial offer to start the negotiation
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=initial_offer_price, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Code:
```py
# Waiting for the seller's response to the initial offer and message
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
