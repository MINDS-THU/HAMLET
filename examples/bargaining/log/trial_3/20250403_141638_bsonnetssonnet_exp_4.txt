Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will send a message to the seller expressing my interest in the Breville Espresso Machine and inquiring if they are open to negotiation. Following this, I'll make an initial offer significantly lower than the listing price, as this will give me room to adjust upwards if needed. I must ensure that the offer does not exceed my maximum willingness to pay, which is $261.25.

# Send a message to the seller

Certainly, the buyer's initial offer of $200 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $521.63, resulting in a negative utility. It's clear that the buyer is interested, which is promising, but we need to steer the negotiation toward a more favorable position.

### Strategy
1. **Reject the current offer** as it's not even close to acceptable.
2. **Respond with a counter-offer** that is closer to our listing price, leaving room for further negotiation.
3. **Highlight the quality and value** of the product to justify the price and encourage a higher counter from the buyer.

Plan: Respond to the offer with a clear rejection while providing a new counter-offer of $799.95 to anchor the negotiation at a feasible level. This approach gives us ample room for concessions moving forward.
