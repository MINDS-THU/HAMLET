Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start the negotiation by sending a message to express my interest in the Onkyo TX-NR6100 AV Receiver and ask if the seller is open to discussing the price. Following that, I will make an initial offer slightly below my bottomline price to leave room for negotiation.

Code:
```py

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has shown interest and made an initial offer at $500, which is significantly lower than my listing price of $799. The bottomline price that I can accept is $189.42, but I want to maximize my utility by negotiating closer to the listing price. I'll counter with a reasonable offer higher than their bid and provide some explanation regarding the quality and features of the AV Receiver. This approach will help anchor the price closer to my expectations while maintaining room for further negotiation.

Let's make a counteroffer and provide some product value justification. 

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the Onkyo TX-NR6100 AV Receiver. This is a premium product with extensive features such as Dolby Atmos and DTS: X playback, multi-room capability, and 8K resolution support.
