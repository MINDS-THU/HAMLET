Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start the negotiation by expressing interest in the MacBook Air and making an initial offer that is below the maximum price I'm willing to pay. This will help anchor the conversation and leave room for concessions. I will also inquire if they are open to adding any non-price incentives like faster shipping or bundled deals to enhance the offer's attractiveness. 

I should aim to keep my initial offer reasonable yet slightly aggressive to signal that I have a firm budget but am still interested in making a deal.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I am interested in the MacBook Air you're selling. Are you open to negotiation? I'm particularly interested to see if there are non-price incentives you could offer as well.")
