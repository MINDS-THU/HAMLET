Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
To begin negotiations for the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH True HEPA Air Purifier, I'll initiate communication with the seller to express interest and check if there's room for negotiation. It's crucial to start the dialogue without revealing the highest price I'm willing to pay at this stage and to assess the seller's willingness to negotiate. 

Let's proceed with sending a message expressing my interest. 

Thought: I'll send a message to the seller indicating my interest in the air purifier and asking if they are open to negotiation. This sets the stage for the negotiation process without revealing any specific price offers yet.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello, I'm interested in purchasing the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH Air Purifier. Is there any flexibility on the price?")
print(message)
```

Output message of the LLM:
I have initiated contact with the seller by expressing interest in the air purifier and inquiring about the possibility of negotiating the price. Now, I'll wait for the seller's response to continue the negotiation process.

Thought: I will wait for the seller's response to my initial message to understand their stance on price flexibility.

```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is interested in the product and is asking about price flexibility. I should start by reiterating the quality and features of the air purifier to emphasize its value, while also mentioning my willingness to negotiate within a reasonable range. I'll send a message highlighting these points and propose an initial price slightly lower than the listing price to kick off the negotiations.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! The Coway Airmega is an excellent choice with its advanced features and high HEPA efficiency. I can offer some flexibility. How about we start at $219.99?")
print(message)

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has shown some flexibility by reducing the price from the listing price of $229.99 to $219.99. As the buyer, my primary goal is to negotiate further to a price below my maximum willingness to pay, which is $137.08. 

Given the seller's starting proposal, I should counter with a significantly lower price to leave room for negotiation, moving progressively closer to my maximum acceptable price with each concession. I'll also mention a strict budget to reinforce my position.

Thought: I will make a counteroffer significantly lower than my maximum price, suggesting $110.00, and mention my budget constraints to negotiate closer to my maximum acceptable price strategically.

Code:
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=110.00, side_offer="Due to budget constraints, I can offer $110.00. Are you willing to consider this?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has proposed $110, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $121.97. I cannot accept this offer as it would lead to a negative utility. I need to counter with a reasonable offer that is closer to my acceptable range, while addressing the buyer's budget constraint with potential value additions.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="I understand budget constraints can be tough. However, $110 is below my minimum feasible price. How about $209.99? I can also consider adding free shipping to sweeten the deal.")

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has reduced the price to $209.99 and offered free shipping. While they've made a concession, this price is still above my maximum willingness to pay of $137.08. I need to continue negotiating to align the final price closer to my acceptable range while acknowledging their offer.

Thought: I'll acknowledge their offer and propose a counteroffer that reflects my maximum price willingness range, moving closer to my upper limit while still maintaining some room for negotiation. I'll offer $125 to see if we can reach a middle ground.

Code:
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=125.00, side_offer="I appreciate the free shipping offer. Considering my budget, would you consider $125?")
