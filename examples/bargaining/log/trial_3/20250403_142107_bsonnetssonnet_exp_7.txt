Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Sure! To start the negotiation, I'll send a message to the seller expressing my interest in the Pendleton, Men's Original Westerley Sweater. I'll also make an initial offer significantly lower than the listing price to anchor the negotiation in our favor. 

Thought: The seller's listing price is $269.0, while my highest price is $105.0. I will start with an initial offer of $70.0 to leave room for negotiation and signal my interest in striking a deal. I'll also mention the maximum price I can pay due to budget constraints.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the Pendleton Sweater. Are you open to negotiations?")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=70.0, side_offer=None)

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has proposed an offer of $70.0, which is significantly below the lowest price I can accept ($193.05). This offer results in negative utility for me and is not acceptable. I'll need to reject this offer clearly and firmly, while indicating a willingness to negotiate further. My next step is to communicate my counter-offer at a price closer to the listing price of $269.0, while leaving room for potential concessions if needed.

Thought: I will reject the current offer and send a message to the buyer to indicate that the offer is too low, also I will make a counter-offer above the minimum acceptable price but below the listing price to start the negotiation process.

Code:
```py
# Reject the buyer's offer
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

# Send a message to the buyer explaining the rejection
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest, but $70.0 is too low for this item. It's a very popular sweater and in high demand. I'd be open to a more reasonable offer closer to its value.")

The seller has responded by rejecting my initial offer of $70.0 and countering with a price of $250.0, along with a side offer of free shipping. Considering that my maximum willingness to pay is $105.0, this price is still significantly higher than my budget.

Thought: I need to counter the seller's offer by increasing my original offer slightly, showing flexibility while still remaining well within my budget. I will propose $85.0 and emphasize my budget constraint to encourage the seller to lower their price further.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I understand it's a popular item, but I'm working with a strict budget. The best I can currently offer is $85.0. Would you consider this?")

The buyer has increased their offer to $100.0, but this is still significantly below the lowest acceptable price of $193.05. Given the buyer's insistence on budget constraints, it seems necessary to make a final attempt at securing a price that yields positive utility for me. I'll need to clearly communicate that I cannot accept the current offer and propose my final offer that is still above my lowest acceptable limit, signaling it as the final move to close the deal.

Thought: I will reject the buyer's offer of $100.0, express understanding of the situation, and present a final offer close to my lowest acceptable price while highlighting the value included.

Thought: Since the seller's final offer is still significantly above my budget constraint and would result in a negative utility, it is in my best interest to politely decline the offer and conclude the negotiation. This will keep options open for future negotiations on other items or potentially circling back if the seller reconsider their stance.
