Sure. I'll start the negotiation by expressing my interest in the product and signaling my willingness to negotiate. I will then make an initial offer that's significantly lower than the listing price but higher than my bottom line to leave room for negotiation.

Thought: I will initiate the negotiation by showing interest and making a first offer at $80 to set an anchor point. This leaves plenty of room for adjustments and tapering concessions. I'll also include a message indicating my excitement about this product, which helps build a positive rapport.

Code:
```py
# Send initial message to express interest and make the first offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the WD 16TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive. Would you be open to negotiation?")
