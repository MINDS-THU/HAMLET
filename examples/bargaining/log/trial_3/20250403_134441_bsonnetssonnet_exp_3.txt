Output message of the LLM:
### Thought:
I will begin the negotiation by expressing interest in the item and asking if the seller is open to negotiation. This will set the tone for the discussion and show that I'm serious about making a purchase, while also expressing my willingness to negotiate the price.

message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi! I'm interested in the Fast X - Collector's Edition 4K. Would you be open to negotiating the price?")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has shown interest in negotiating the price. This gives me an opportunity to engage with them and try to secure the best possible price close to my listing price of $49.98. I will start with a slight reduction in price to signal willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position. I'll propose a price higher than my lowest acceptable price to leave room for concessions.

The seller has proposed a new offer of $47.99, which is above my maximum willing price of $24.98. Since this offer is significantly higher than my limit, I will respond by making a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum price, emphasizing the budget constraint to encourage the seller to consider a more favorable deal for me.

### Code:
```py

### Thought:
The seller has rejected my offer and countered with $46.00, which is still above my maximum willing price. To strategically negotiate, I will need to increase my counteroffer slightly but still keep it well within my affordable range to signal willingness to negotiate but also reinforce my budget constraints. I'll also mention possible alternative purchases to apply leverage.
