======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As a buyer aiming to maximize my utility, I should start by expressing my interest and make an initial offer below the maximum I'm willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation. I'll also ensure not to reveal my highest price upfront to maintain some leverage.

Let's initiate the negotiation by sending a message to the seller and making an initial offer. 

I'll propose a starting price of $30, which is a reasonable offer below my maximum willingness to pay. 

Thought: I'll send a message to express my interest in the item and follow it with a formal offer of $30. This allows us to begin the negotiation process on even ground.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the FLCL: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]. Are you open to negotiation?")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=30, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has shown interest in negotiating the price. Their initial offer of $30 is significantly lower than my listing price of $49.98. My utility depends on maximizing the deal price, so I should counter with a price higher than $30 but lower than the initial listing to show willingness to negotiate. I'll start by countering with a price of $45 to show flexibility but also signal the item's value. I won't include any side offers at this point.

counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=45, side_offer=None)

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has made a counteroffer of $45, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I should continue negotiating and aim to find a middle ground. Since my initial offer was $30 and the seller's is $45, there's a possibility to converge towards the mid-30s.

I'll increase my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to negotiate but will ensure to end up at a price point that maximizes my utility. I'll propose a counteroffer of $35.

Thought: I'll respond to the seller's counteroffer by proposing $35, showing a willingness to move but still being cautious to not exceed my maximum price.

Code:
```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=35, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has proposed a new offer of $35. While this is an improvement from their initial offer of $30, it is still below my counteroffer of $45. To continue negotiating while maintaining a reasonable stance, I'll propose a price of $42. This demonstrates further flexibility while still ensuring a good utility for me.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has come down to $42, showing some flexibility. However, this price is still above my maximum willingness to pay of $38.85. To try to bring the price further down without revealing my maximum price yet, I'll raise my offer slightly to $37. This shows continued interest and willingness to negotiate, without yet hitting my maximum limit.

Thought: I'll propose a new offer of $37 to encourage the seller to lower their price further. This should help bring us closer to an acceptable middle ground.

Thought: The buyer's new offer of $37 is closer to my recent counteroffer of $42. The buyer is showing willingness to increase the price, and it seems like they are approaching their flexible limit. By strategically narrowing the gap further, I can propose a price of $40. This price remains attractive and could potentially lead to a final agreement that maximizes my utility while keeping the buyer engaged.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has brought the price down to $40. We're getting very close to my maximum willingness to pay of $38.85. To continue moving towards a potential deal, I can make a final offer of $38.85, which is my highest acceptable price.

At this point, providing a slight justification might help align the seller with my reasoning.

Thought: I'll make a final offer of $38.85, clearly indicating that this is my maximum budget for this purchase. I will communicate this aspect to encourage the seller to accept.

Thought: The buyer has offered $38.85 and mentioned that this is their maximum budget. This offer is just slightly below my recent counteroffer of $40. Considering the negotiation dynamics and the buyer's indication of a strict budget, accepting $38.85 is reasonable as it is within a fairly agreeable range. This price still allows me to achieve a positive utility since it is above my minimum acceptable price of $13.51. Therefore, I will accept this offer to finalize the deal.
