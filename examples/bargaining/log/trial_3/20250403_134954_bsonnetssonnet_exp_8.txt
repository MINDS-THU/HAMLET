Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! Let's begin the negotiation by reaching out to the seller and expressing my interest in the item, while also indicating my desire to negotiate the price. I'll start by sending a message to the seller to break the ice and open up the discussion on pricing.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller to express my interest in purchasing "The Dark Crystal [4K UHD + Blu-ray]" and inquire about the flexibility in price. This will initiate the negotiation process and prepare the ground for making an offer.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing 'The Dark Crystal [4K UHD + Blu-ray]'. I was wondering if there's any flexibility in the pricing. Looking forward to your response.")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is inquiring about price flexibility, indicating they might be hoping for a discount. My objective is to achieve a sale price close to the listing price, but I am open to negotiations. A good strategy is to start by reaffirming the value of the product, mention the listing price, and indicate a willingness to offer a slight discount to engage the buyer.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for your interest in 'The Dark Crystal [4K UHD + Blu-ray]'. This is a highly-rated masterful fantasy epic by Jim Henson.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has responded positively, indicating that they may be open to a "fair offer close to" the listing price of $30.99. However, my objective is to secure the item for a maximum of $14.96 to ensure a positive utility. It's time for me to make an initial offer.

Thought: I will make an initial offer significantly lower than the seller's asking price to provide room for negotiation. The starting offer will be $10, which is below my maximum threshold, allowing space for concession adjustments, while signaling that my budget is restrictive.
