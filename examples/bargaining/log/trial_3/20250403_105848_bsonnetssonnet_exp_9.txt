Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will begin the negotiation by expressing interest in the item and asking if there is any flexibility on the price. This will help open the discussion for a lower offer without committing to a price right away.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I should respond to the buyer's message with a professional yet firm stance. Initial flexibility is shown through potential incentives rather than price reduction. I will mention the value and limited availability of the item to justify the initial asking price, which will set the stage for potential counteroffers that still maintain my target utility. I will also communicate openness to reasonable negotiation to encourage the buyer to make an offer.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for your interest in the Ghost in the Shell 4K UHD package. It's a rare item with a lot of value for collectors. While I'm open to reasonable offers, please note that the current price reflects its limited availability and demand. Let me know what you have in mind.")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has indicated openness to reasonable offers but emphasized the item's rarity and demand. I will make a counteroffer below my highest acceptable price to leave room for negotiation and test the seller's flexibility. Starting slightly above half-way between my target price and the listing price would be a good strategy.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's offer of 17.5 gives me a utility of \(17.5 - 8.05 = 9.45\), which is a reasonable start but still below the listing price. I can counter with a price between their offer and the listing price to nudge them closer to our initial target. I will also reinforce the item's value to justify the counter-offer. Additionally, I could offer a small side incentive to make the offer more attractive.
