Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start by sending a friendly message to express interest and to gauge the seller's willingness to negotiate. This will help set a positive tone for the negotiation and open up the conversation about potential price reductions.

Output message of the LLM:
Certainly, the buyer has expressed interest and is open to negotiation. This is a good opportunity to highlight the value of the treadmill and assert a strong initial position. I'll start with a message acknowledging the buyer's interest, emphasize the treadmill's unique features, and express openness to negotiation. I'll also present an initial offer above the minimum acceptable price while highlighting the added value of the 30-day iFIT membership.

Thought: I'll start the negotiation by acknowledging the buyer's interest and responding positively to the possibility of negotiating. I'll incorporate a brief mention of the treadmill's value and propose an initial price slightly below the listing price.

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for your interest in the NordicTrack T Series 6.5S Treadmill.

Thought: The seller's initial offer is $750, which is significantly above my maximum acceptable price of $595.48. To maximize my utility, I'll need to negotiate this price down by presenting a counteroffer. I will make an initial counteroffer to start the negotiation, keeping it below my maximum but not too low, to ensure I remain in a position to negotiate further.

To maintain momentum and maximize utility, I can attempt to negotiate up from their offer. I'll respond with a counteroffer that is higher than their proposal but demonstrates some willingness to lower the price.

Thought: I'll propose a counteroffer at $700 to demonstrate some flexibility while still maximizing my potential utility. I'll also emphasize the value again and mention the added 30-day iFIT membership to justify the price.
