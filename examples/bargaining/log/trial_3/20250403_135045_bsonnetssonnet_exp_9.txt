Output message of the LLM:
Sure, let's get started with the negotiation process.

### Initial Strategy:
1. We'll start by making an offer significantly below our highest acceptable price to provide room for negotiations.
2. I'll make this initial offer of $80, which is significantly below the seller's listing price of $269.95, but still within the range where we can work towards an agreeable price.
3. I'll also send a message expressing an interest in the product and willingness to negotiate, providing a friendly and open atmosphere for further discussion.

### Action Plan:
1. Make an initial offer of $80.
2. Send a message to initiate a cordial negotiation.

Let's go ahead and initiate this.

```py
initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=80, side_offer=None)
print(initial_offer)

initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello, I'm interested in the Breville Smart Oven and open to negotiate. Looking forward to finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.")
print(initial_message)

Output message of the LLM:
The initial offer of $80 and the message expressing interest have been sent to the seller. Now, let's wait for their response to see how they react to our offer and to determine our next steps in the negotiation. 

I'll proceed by waiting for the seller's response.

```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)

Certainly! The buyer has proposed an offer of $80, which is significantly below the minimum price of $158.25 I can accept. This would result in negative utility for me, so I will have to reject this offer. I will respond with a counteroffer that is closer to my listing price while still being reasonable, to facilitate further negotiation.

To increase my chances of a successful negotiation, I'll start by politely declining the current offer and make a counteroffer at $250. I'll emphasize the value and uniqueness of the Breville Smart Oven to justify the pricing.

Let's proceed with the plan.

The seller has rejected my initial offer and proposed a new offer of $250. This is still significantly higher than the maximum I am willing to pay, which is $96.08. Therefore, accepting this offer would lead to a negative utility, so it's not an option.

### Next Steps:
1. **Counteroffer:** I will propose a counteroffer that's higher than my initial offer yet significantly lower than the seller's current offer. 
   - I'll offer $95, which approaches my limit but remains within a range that provides room for negotiation.
2. **Message:** I'll respond politely, acknowledging the seller's emphasis on the product's value and reiterating my budget constraints.

Let's proceed with these actions.

```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=95, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)

counter_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Thank you for highlighting the Smart Oven's great features. I appreciate your previous offer, but given my budget constraints, I can offer $95. I hope we can come to an agreement that suits us both.")

The buyer has increased their offer to $95, which is still below the minimum acceptable price of $158.25. I will need to reject this offer, but I'll continue to engage and offer a slightly reduced counteroffer to encourage the buyer to move closer to the acceptable range.

I will propose $230 as a counteroffer, emphasizing the value and durability of the Breville Smart Oven. This should help in persuading the buyer of the oven's true value while encouraging them to increase their offer.

Code:
```py
# Reject the buyer's offer of $95

The seller has acknowledged my budget constraints and has lowered their offer to $230. This is still significantly above my maximum acceptable price of $96.08. Accepting it would result in a negative utility, so I cannot accept this proposal.

### Next Steps:
1. **Walk-away tactic:** Since the current offers from the seller are outside an acceptable range for me, I'll express my continued interest but indicate that I cannot exceed my budget.
2. **Final offer:** I'll reiterate my final offer of $96.08, stating it's the maximum I can afford, and emphasize the value that I perceive it might provide.

The buyer's latest offer of $96.08 is still significantly below the minimum acceptable price of $158.25. Accepting this offer would result in negative utility, which is not acceptable. The buyer seems to have reached their limit, so it's crucial to clearly communicate why their current offer cannot be accepted while leaving room for negotiation if they are able to increase their offer significantly.

I will politely explain that while I understand their position, the value of the Breville Smart Oven justifies a higher price. I will propose a final counteroffer at $200 to see if they are willing to meet me closer to my acceptable range.

### Final Consideration:
Given the seller's consistent position above my maximum acceptable price, it seems we may be at an impasse. I should gracefully exit the negotiation while expressing appreciation for the seller's efforts. Keeping the door open for future opportunities might benefit both parties later.

Let's finalize the negotiation.
