Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
To initiate the negotiation, I will first send a message to express interest in the item and inquire about the possibility of negotiation. This will help gauge the seller's openness to price discussions. After that, I will make an initial offer slightly below my maximum willing price to set the stage for further negotiation.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller to express my interest in the item and ask if they are open to negotiation. Then, I'll make an initial offer to start the negotiation process.

Code:
```py
# Expressing interest and inquiring about negotiation possibilities
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I am interested in the CAP Barbell 150 LB Coated Hex Dumbbell Weight Set. Are you open to negotiation?")
print(message)

# Making an initial offer

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer has shown interest in negotiating and has made an initial offer of $160, which is significantly lower than our listing price of $249.99. However, this offer is above our lowest acceptable price of $114.27.

### Strategy
1. **Counter Offer:** Provide a counteroffer that is higher than the buyer's offer but below our initial listing price. This allows room for negotiation.
2. **Highlight Product Value:** Emphasize the unique qualities and benefits of the dumbbell set to justify a higher price.
3. **Utilize Precise Pricing:** Use a precise number to indicate thoughtfulness in the counteroffer and signal limited flexibility for further negotiations.

### Counteroffer Plan
To maintain utility, I will make a counteroffer at $220. This is above the buyer's offer while still below our initial price, potentially encouraging further negotiation toward a favorable agreement.

Let's proceed with this plan.

```py
# Send a counteroffer with our calculated price.
counter_offer_price = 220
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=counter_offer_price, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)

# Highlight the advantages of the product to enhance perceived value.
message_content = (
    "Thank you for your interest in the dumbbell set. With its space-saving design and durable construction, "
    "this versatile set is perfect for home workouts. Based on its quality and market value, I can offer you a deal at $220."
)

# Highlight the advantages of the product to enhance perceived value.
message_content = (
    "Thank you for your interest in the dumbbell set. With its space-saving design and durable construction, "
    "this versatile set is perfect for home workouts. Based on its quality and market value, I can offer you a deal at $220."

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has countered with an offer of $220, which is above my maximum willingness to pay. The seller also highlighted the value and quality of the dumbbell set. To move forward, I will respond to the offer with a slightly increased counter-offer to show my willingness to negotiate, but I will still keep it within my limit.

Thought: I will make a counter-offer slightly above my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and continue the negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Making a counter-offer
counter_offer_price = 170  # Increasing the initial offer slightly
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=counter_offer_price, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)

======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I've made a counter-offer of $170 to continue the negotiation. Now, I should wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to meet my counter-offer or propose another offer.

response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer slightly from $160 to $170. While this is a positive sign, the offer is still significantly lower than our counteroffer of $220. 

### Strategy
1. **Tapered Concession:** Offer a concession to move the negotiation closer towards their price but also highlight that we're nearing our bottom line to manage expectations.
2. **Continue Persuasion:** Reinforce the value and unique features of the product to justify the higher price.
3. **Make a New Counteroffer:** Provide a new price that shows some flexibility but remains favorable to our utility goals.

### Counteroffer Plan
I'll propose a new counteroffer at $205, demonstrating flexibility while still working towards a favorable outcome.

Let's proceed with this plan.

```py
# Send a new counteroffer with a reduced price.
new_counter_offer_price = 205
new_counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=new_counter_offer_price, side_offer=None)
print(new_counter_offer)

# Reinforce the product's value to the buyer.
message_content = (
    "I appreciate your revised offer. The dumbbell set is crafted with durable materials and a compact design to save space, "
    "making it a valuable addition to any home gym. I am willing to lower the price to $205 for you."

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has lowered their price to $205, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay of $172.78. I need to communicate my budget constraint clearly while making another counter-offer that is closer to what I am willing to pay.

Thought: I will communicate my strict budget limitation and make a close-to-final counter-offer to encourage the seller to meet me closer to my maximum willingness to pay.

Code:
```py
# Sending a message to communicate budget constraints and making a final counter-offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I appreciate your concession, but I do have a strict budget limit. The highest I can go is $172.78. I hope we can work something out.")

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made it clear that they have a strict budget limit of $172.78. This offer is getting closer to our acceptable range but is still below our last counteroffer of $205.

### Strategy
1. **Evaluate Current Offer:** The buyer is close to their stated limit, and this might be their final offer.
2. **Consider Acceptance:** Analytically, $172.78 provides a positive utility and might be the best deal we can achieve given their constraints.
3. **Ensure Future Transactions:** By accepting, establish a good rapport for potential future deals.

Given their budget constraint and the fact that the utility remains positive ($172.78 - $114.27 = $58.51), it makes sense to consider accepting this offer to close the deal amicably.

```py
# Accept the buyer's offer of $172.78.
accept_offer = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
print(accept_offer)

# Send a message confirming the acceptance and expressing interest in future transactions.
