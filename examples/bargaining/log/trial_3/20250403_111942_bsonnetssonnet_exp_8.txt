Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To initiate the negotiation effectively, I should start by showing interest in the item, and then making an initial offer slightly below my maximum budget. This keeps me flexible for any necessary adjustments during the negotiation.

Since the listing price is $44.99 and my highest acceptable price is $35.07, I'll start with an initial offer significantly lower but still reasonable, to leave room for negotiation. I'll aim to keep my initial offer at $28.00.

Let's start by expressing interest and then making the initial offer.

Sure, let's evaluate the buyer's offer and respond strategically.

### Current Situation:
- **Listing Price:** $44.99
- **Buyer's Offer:** $28.00 (which gives me a utility of $28.00 - $13.92 = $14.08)
- **Lowest Acceptable Price:** $13.92
- **Our Strategy:**
  - The buyer's offer gives me some utility, but it's significantly below our listing price.
  - I will make a counter-offer that reflects some concession but maintains my pricing strength.
  - I'll propose a price slightly lower than the listing price with a small side offer to make it more appealing.

### Action Plan:
1. **Counter Offer:** Provide a counter-offer higher than the buyer's offer but slightly below my initial listing price.
2. **Include a Side Offer:** Consider including a minor incentive like free shipping to make the offer more attractive.

Let's make a counter-offer.
