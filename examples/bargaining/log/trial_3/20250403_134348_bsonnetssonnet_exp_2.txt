======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As a buyer, my goal is to negotiate a price lower than the seller's initial asking price of $80 while keeping the limit of $33.51 in mind. I will begin by expressing interest in the item and make an initial offer significantly below the listing price to create room for further negotiation.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller stating my interest and then make an initial offer lower than my maximum willingness to pay to start the negotiation. This will allow room for adjustments as we negotiate further.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the DKNY Be Delicious Eau de Parfum. Are you open to negotiating a better price?")
print(message)

Output message of the LLM:
Sure, let's analyze the situation and plan the next move. The buyer has shown interest and made an initial low offer of 25.0, which is below my acceptable minimum of 43.22. I need to reject this offer but also keep the buyer engaged. I will counter with a more reasonable offer closer to the listing price to start negotiating from a favorable position.

I'll make a counteroffer of 75.0 and highlight the perfume's freshness and charm to emphasize its value.

Thought: I will reject the current low offer and make a counteroffer with a price of 75.0, including a message emphasizing the value of the perfume. This maintains the negotiation at a reasonable level and keeps the conversation open.

Code:
```py
# Rejecting the buyer's offer

Thought: I will make a counteroffer closer to my maximum price and mention I could facilitate a fast payment to sweeten the deal.

To maintain engagement and encourage the buyer to meet a more reasonable price, I will reject the current offer and propose a new counteroffer. I will offer the perfume at 70.0 and mention the high demand and popularity of the fragrance to justify the price, while also keeping the option open for a quick and smooth transaction.

I need to continue to negotiate with a counteroffer that nudges them closer to a price acceptable to me while acknowledging their expressed budget constraint. I'll propose a compromise at 65.0, hinting that it's a fair middle ground considering the quality and popularity of the product.

I'll communicate this while giving a final counteroffer at the minimum acceptable price of 43.22, emphasizing that this is the lowest possible price I can offer, and explaining the value and demand for the product.
