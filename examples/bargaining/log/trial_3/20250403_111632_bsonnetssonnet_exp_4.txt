Certainly! The buyer is initiating a negotiation, which provides us with an opportunity to potentially secure a favorable deal. Since they're interested in negotiating, it indicates there's room for discussion on pricing. 

My strategy will be to start with the listing price to anchor the negotiation but to also express a willingness to entertain offers. This approach sets a solid initial position while remaining open to further dialogue.

Let's proceed by sending a message to the buyer and making an initial offer at the listing price of $49.99. I will not include any side offers at this stage to keep the focus on the price.
