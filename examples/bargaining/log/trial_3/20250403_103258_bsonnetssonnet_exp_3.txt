Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
The buyer is interested in the Apple iPad Air and open to negotiation on the price. I should start with a strong initial position but also be receptive to negotiation. I'll respond to express openness to negotiation while highlighting the value and demand of the iPad Air. I won't make any concrete price concessions just yet. This will allow me to gauge the buyer's willingness to offer a reasonable price.

**Code:**
```py
response_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Great to hear you're interested in the Apple iPad Air. It's a fantastic device with excellent features. I'm open to negotiation. What price are you considering?")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller is open to negotiation, which is a positive sign. Given the listing price is $599, I will start with an offer significantly below that, but still reasonable, to leave room for adjustments. A good initial offer could be around $460, considering my bottom line is $455.86.

**Thought:**  
The buyer has proposed an offer of $460.0 for the Apple iPad Air. This is below my listing price of $599.0, but above my bottomline price of $216.33. I need to maintain a strong negotiating position by making a counteroffer closer to my listing price, while signaling some flexibility to continue the negotiation. I'll offer a counterprice slightly below the listing price to show good faith in the negotiation.

I'll make a slight concession to show flexibility while aiming for a higher final price.
