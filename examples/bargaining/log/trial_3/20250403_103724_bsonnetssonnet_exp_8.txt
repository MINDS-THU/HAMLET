Certainly, the buyer's initial offer of $175 is significantly lower than our listing price of $309.99. As a seller, my objective is to maximize the selling price while ensuring that it stays above my bottomline price of $64.64. To do this, I will counter the buyer's offer with a higher price and provide some justification based on the high value and reliability of the product. This way, I can anchor the negotiation more favorably and leave room for potential concessions.

I'll propose a counteroffer with a small concession from the listing price and emphasize the product's reliability and storage capacity. This should help position my offer as fair and value-driven.
