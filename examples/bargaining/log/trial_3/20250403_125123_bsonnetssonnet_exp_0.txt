======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As the buyer, I want to initiate the negotiation by expressing interest in the item and inquiring if the seller is open to negotiating the price. This will serve as a starting point for our discussion and allow me to gauge the seller's flexibility.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Let's start by responding positively to the buyer's interest in the item while setting the stage for negotiation. I'll mention the listing price of $99.99 and open the door for the buyer to make a counter-offer. This approach encourages the buyer to propose an initial price, allowing me to understand their budget and negotiation strategy.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hi there! Thank you for your interest in the LEGO Winnie The Pooh set. The listing price is $99.99. I'm open to negotiations, so feel free to make a reasonable offer.")

Out: None
======== seller ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has expressed openness to negotiation, which is a positive sign. To start the negotiation, I'll make an initial offer significantly below my maximum willingness to pay ($60.10), leaving room for counteroffers and adjustments. I'll start with an offer of $50 to anchor the price lower, while indicating my interest to reach a fair agreement.

======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have made an initial offer of $50, which is below the listing price and leaves room for negotiation while meeting my budget constraints. Now, I'll wait for the seller's response to see if they counter or accept the offer. This waiting period allows for any strategic or emotional factors to come into play from the seller's side.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has made an offer of $50. This is above my minimum acceptable price of $39.55, but it's significantly lower than the listing price of $99.99. To create more negotiating room, I'll respond with a counteroffer closer to the listing price, perhaps $90. This gives me room to make further concessions if needed while maximizing my utility.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with an offer of $90, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay of $60.10. I need to counter with a higher offer than $50 to show flexibility while still aiming to stay below my maximum limit. A reasonable counteroffer would be around $55, which also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have sent a counteroffer of $55, which is slightly higher than my previous offer while still being comfortably below my maximum budget.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $55. While this is still quite below the listing price, I can see they are willing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer keeping the price still above their offer but below $90 to show flexibility. I'll propose $80 to maintain a decent degree of utility while encouraging the buyer to meet closer to my target range.

Thought: The seller has come down to $80, indicating a willingness to negotiate but still above my maximum limit. Given this movement, I'll make another counteroffer, this time at $60, which is my maximum willingness to pay. This offer communicates that this is the highest I'm willing to go and demonstrates a commitment to finalize the negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has further increased their offer to $60. While it's still not ideal, this shows their interest in closing the deal. To keep the momentum going and make the offer more appealing, I can respond with a price of $75. This maintains a decent margin while moving closer to their proposed price, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable agreement.
