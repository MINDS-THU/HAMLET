Thought: The buyer is interested in negotiating the price of the iRobot Roomba i3 EVO. My listing price is $349.99, and I want to maximize my utility while adhering to the bottomline price of $110.73. Initially, I'll acknowledge the buyer's interest and present them with an attractive offer to start negotiations. I'll also emphasize the product's unique features and high demand to justify the asking price.

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for your interest in the iRobot Roomba i3 EVO. It's a fantastic choice with its Smart Mapping and 10x Power-Lifting Suction features. Given its high demand, I can offer it to you for $335.99.")

I should make a counteroffer to move closer to my maximum budget while still maintaining some room for further negotiation. I'll aim for $270, which is above my bottomline and provides room for further concessions if needed.

To keep the discussion ongoing and steer towards my target price, I need to make a counteroffer, showing some flexibility but still closer to my initial offer and above my bottomline price.

I will make a final counteroffer as close as possible to my bottomline to see if I can secure the deal. I'll offer $295, which shows further compromise from my side but stays within my budget constraints.
