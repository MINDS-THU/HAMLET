I will send a message highlighting the key features and value of the product and indicate that while the listing price is competitive, I am open to consider their offer.

The buyer has made an initial offer of $250, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $290.51. To maximize my utility, I need to make a counteroffer that brings us closer to my target price while still leaving room for negotiation.

I will reject the current offer as it provides negative utility and propose a counteroffer significantly closer to the listing price. This approach maintains my stance on the value of the product and encourages the buyer to consider a more reasonable offer.
