Given that the listing price is $49.99 and the maximum price I am willing to pay is $26.31, I need to start negotiating by proposing a strong initial offer. I'll start with an offer significantly below my maximum price to leave room for adjustments while keeping my interests in mind. To maintain a professional tone, I'll also send a message to the seller to express my interest in the product and to set the stage for negotiation.

Thought: I will draft a message to the seller expressing my interest in the LEGO set and make an initial offer of $20. This offer provides me room to make further concessions if needed without reaching my limit too quickly.

# Sending a message to the seller expressing interest in the LEGO set

Sure, let's approach this strategically.

### Thought Process:
1. **Initial Assessment**: The buyer has made a first offer of $20, which is below our listing price of $49.99 and above our lowest acceptable price of $15.9. However, it is quite low compared to the listing price.
2. **Strategic Response**: I will counter with a price that is reasonable but closer to my listing price. This will help anchor the negotiation around a higher price point.
3. **Offer Justification**: I will mention the popularity and demand for LEGO Star Wars sets to underscore the value the buyer is getting.
4. **Adjusting Expectations**: By making a counter-offer at a higher price than what the buyer suggested will also indicate that the current offer isn't acceptable and that I'm looking for something significantly closer to the listing price.

### Action Plan:
- Counter the buyer's offer with a price slightly lower than the listing price but significantly higher than their offer to continue negotiations.
- Use the popularity of the product as justification for the counter-offer.

Let's execute this plan by making a counter-offer.
