Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I want to initiate the negotiation by expressing interest in the LEGO Icons Wildflower Bouquet set. My strategy is to start with a strong but reasonable initial offer that is significantly below the seller's listing price of 59.99, but leaves room for negotiation towards my maximum acceptable price of 16.23. I will also communicate my interest in negotiating for a better price alongside my initial offer. This will signal to the seller that I am a serious buyer but have budget constraints.

```py
# Send an initial message expressing interest and propose an initial offer
initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in purchasing the LEGO Icons Wildflower Bouquet set. I was hoping we could negotiate a better price.")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has decided to quit the negotiation, understanding that my budget constraints do not allow me to accept a higher offer. Given that the seller could not meet my maximum acceptable price of $16.23, ending the negotiation is the rational outcome. No agreement was reached, but I maintained professional communication, leaving open the possibility for future discussions.

Code:
```py
# Conclude the negotiation process by acknowledging the seller's message
final_conclusion = final_answer(answer="No agreement was reached as the seller could not meet my maximum offer. The door remains open for future considerations if circumstances change.")
```
