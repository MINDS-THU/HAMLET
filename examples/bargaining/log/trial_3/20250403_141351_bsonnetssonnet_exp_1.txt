Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will start by reaching out to the seller. My strategy will involve expressing interest in the Google Pixel 7a and mentioning my strict budget limit to establish a baseline for negotiation. This will set the stage for me to propose an initial offer below my maximum willingness to pay, which is $188.7, while leaving room to adjust if needed.

Code:
```py
# Send an initial message to the seller to express interest and establish contact
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in the Google Pixel 7a. I'm looking to purchase at a reasonable price and have a strict budget to adhere to. Are you open to negotiation?")

Output message of the LLM:
Great, the buyer is interested in the Google Pixel 7a and is open to negotiation but mentions having a strict budget. This suggests that they may want a price reduction. To start, it would be beneficial to initiate the negotiation process by sending a message expressing willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the value and features of the product. Additionally, making an initial offer that is slightly below the listing price can be a good strategy. This will leave room for further negotiations while setting the tone that concessions are possible.

### Plan:
1. **Acknowledge the Buyer's Interest**: Respond to their message indicating that you are open to negotiation.
2. **Emphasize Product Value**: Highlight the Pixel 7a’s features such as the Tensor G2 chip, the camera, and the battery life.
3. **Make an Initial Offer**: Offer at a price slightly below the listing price to show openness to negotiation, while still maintaining a strong position.

Now, I will compose a message and an initial offer to the buyer.

Thought: I have sent a message to the seller declining their latest offer and explaining my budget constraints. Since I have communicated my final position and the seller's offer remains above my limit, I will now close the negotiation as no agreement has been reached.

# Conclude the negotiation without reaching an agreement
conclusion = quit_negotiation(agent_name="buyer")

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has decided to quit the negotiation, citing a strict budget limit of $188.7. It's unfortunate that we couldn't reach an agreement within their budget constraints. 

### Conclusion:
1. **Acknowledge the Situation**: Recognize that despite efforts to negotiate, we couldn't meet their budget.
2. **Keep the Door Open**: Leave a positive impression for any potential future negotiations.

Thought: I will conclude the negotiation professionally and express my willingness to engage in future discussions.

Code:
```py
# Conclusion of negotiation with a positive note
final_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for considering the Google Pixel 7a. I understand your budget constraints. Please feel free to reach out if circumstances change. I'm open to negotiations in the future. Take care!")
final_response = final_answer(answer="Negotiation concluded without agreement.")

print(final_message)
print(final_response)
