======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To initiate the negotiation, I will send a message to express interest and set a friendly tone for the discussion, followed by an initial offer that is below the listing price but within a reasonable range to start the negotiation process. 

This offer will be just above the minimum price I'm willing to pay, allowing room for negotiation and concessions.

Let's start with that. 

Thought: I will send a message to the seller to express my interest in the item and then make an initial offer slightly below my maximum acceptable price to initiate the negotiation. This will establish my interest but also set a clear boundary as a starting point.

Code:
```py
# Send a message to express interest in the item.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi! I'm interested in purchasing the AVENGERS: 4K ENDGAME [Blu-ray] [4K UHD]. I'm hoping we can negotiate a good price that suits both of us.")

# Propose an initial offer that is below the maximum price I'm willing to pay.
initial_offer_price = 20.00  # Initial offer price to start the negotiation.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=initial_offer_price, side_offer=None)

print(message)

# Propose an initial offer that is below the maximum price I'm willing to pay.

Output message of the LLM:
Great! I've successfully sent a message expressing interest in the item and made an initial offer of $20.00 to start the negotiation process. Now, I'll wait for a response from the seller to see their reaction to the initial offer and adjust our strategy accordingly.

Thought: I will wait for the seller's response to my message and offer, which will help me gauge their flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

```py
# Wait for the seller's response to my initial offer and message.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer's initial offer of $20.00 is below my minimum acceptable price of $23.07. Accepting this offer would result in negative utility for me, which is unacceptable.

### Plan:
1. **Reject the Offer:** The offer is below my minimum acceptable price, so I will reject it.
2. **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer. Since the listing price is $39.99, I will counter at a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price to anchor the negotiation towards a midpoint, say around $35.00.
3. **Message:** I will send a message explaining the value of the product and emphasize that the current offer is below market value.

**Objective:** Ensure any sales price is above $23.07 and aim as close as possible to the listing price of $39.99 to maximize utility.

Let's execute this plan. 

```py
# Step 1: Reject the current offer
reject_response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(reject_response)

# Step 2: Make a counteroffer

# Step 3: Send a message explaining the value of the product
message_content = "Thank you for your interest! This is a high-value collector's piece, and the current offer doesn't reflect its market value. Let's find a price that works for both. I can offer it to you for $35.00."

The seller has responded, rejecting my initial offer and proposing a new price of $35.00. They've also emphasized the item's value as a collector's piece. However, $35.00 is above my maximum acceptable price of $23.64.

To proceed, I will make a counteroffer closer to my limit, signaling flexibility but also showing I'm reaching my threshold. This can help demonstrate my seriousness about negotiating while maintaining my utility.

Thought: I will make a counteroffer slightly below my maximum acceptable price to signal my budget constraints while keeping room for possible further negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Counteroffer slightly below my maximum acceptable price to demonstrate my seriousness
counteroffer_price = 22.00  # Counteroffer price

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has proposed a new offer of $22.0. This is still below my minimum acceptable price of $23.07, so accepting would result in negative utility, which is worse than no deal at all.

### Plan:
1. **Reject the Offer:** Since $22.0 is below my minimum acceptable price, I will reject this offer.
2. **Reassess and Counter:** I will approach with a more moderate counteroffer to keep the negotiation engaging. I'll slightly reduce my previous offer to show willingness to compromise, perhaps to around $33.00.
3. **Reiterate Product Value:** Emphasize that this product is a sought-after item with significant value in the market.

**Objective:** Counter while maintaining an acceptable price above $23.07, improving the chances of a mutually beneficial outcome.
