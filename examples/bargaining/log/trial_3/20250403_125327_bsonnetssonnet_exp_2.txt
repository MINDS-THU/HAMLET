Output message of the LLM:
Given the highest price I'm willing to pay is 69.8, I want to start the negotiation with an offer lower than that to leave room for compromise while still showing interest. I will send a message to the seller to express my interest in the item and make an initial offer that is considerably lower than my maximum, but not so low as to be dismissed immediately. 

Let's start by making an initial offer of 55.

```py
message_1 = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in the Instant Pot Air Fryer Oven. Are you open to negotiation on the price?")

The buyer is interested in negotiating the price for the Instant Pot Air Fryer Oven and has proposed an offer of $55, which is significantly lower than my listing price of $99.95, but above my lowest acceptable price of $39.7. 

Let's follow these steps:

1. **Acknowledge interest:** I'll send a message acknowledging the buyer's interest.
2. **Counter-offer:** I'll propose a higher price than the buyer's offer, creating some room for negotiation while still keeping the price attractive to them. A reasonable counter-offer could be around $90, as it sets a positive precedent while remaining flexible.
3. **Emphasize value:** In the message, I'll highlight the value this product brings, such as its versatility, quality, and safety features, to justify the price.
4. **Signal willingness to negotiate:** Indicate openness to discuss terms further, maintaining a positive negotiation atmosphere.

Let's proceed with these actions.

The buyer has countered with an offer of $60. While this is an improvement over the initial $55 offer, it's still quite a bit below my counter-offer of $90 and considerably under the listing price of $99.95. 

Here's the plan:

1. **Acknowledge the counter-offer:** I'll appreciate the buyer's willingness to negotiate.
2. **Counter again:** I'll make another offer between my last counter-offer and their offer, perhaps around $85, to keep the negotiation engaging while still working to reach a higher final price.
3. **Highlight product features:** Continue to emphasize the advantages and quality of the product to justify the asking price.

Let's implement this plan.

The buyer has increased their offer to $65. While this is a step in the right direction, it's still below my counter-offer of $85. However, it indicates that they are willing to negotiate further.

Here's the plan:

1. **Acknowledge the buyer's offer:** I will continue to show a willingness to negotiate, building a positive rapport.
2. **Propose a new counter-offer:** I'll aim to bridge the gap further by offering a price of $80. This keeps the negotiation going without conceding too much.
3. **Emphasize limited availability:** I'll mention that these units tend to sell quickly due to their popularity, adding a sense of urgency.

Code:
```py

Given these circumstances, here are the strategic steps to take:

1. **Acknowledge the buyer's position:** I should express appreciation for their willingness to reach an agreement.
2. **Consider accepting the offer:** Since the buyer has indicated this is their maximum, accepting their offer ensures a successful deal, while maintaining goodwill with the buyer.
