To maximize my utility as the seller, I will respond to the buyer's inquiry and the offer. I want to set a strong position while leaving room to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price. The offered price of $80 is considerably lower than my listing price of $118.67, but still above my bottomline price. I will counter this initial offer with a higher price than what the buyer proposed, but lower than the listing price, to keep the negotiation open. Additionally, I will emphasize the value and quality of the product to justify the price.

Let's make a counteroffer and send a message to emphasize the product's value.

Thought: I will send a message highlighting the product's value and quality, along with a counteroffer closer to the listing price but leaving room for further negotiation. This will be part of my strategy to reach an agreeable price within my acceptable range.

Code:

I will acknowledge their new offer and propose another counteroffer slightly lower than my previous one to show willingness to negotiate. This will signal to the buyer that I'm flexible, but still firm on a fair price.

Thought: I will send a message to acknowledge the buyer's move and present a new counteroffer, reducing my last offer slightly to $100, which is closer to our desired price range but still higher than what they offered.

I want to encourage the buyer to meet closer to my desired range by offering at $95, highlighting the product's lifetime warranty and quality.

Thought: I will send a message emphasizing the importance of the product's quality and longevity, then make a counteroffer of $95. This shows that I'm interested in reaching a fair compromise.
