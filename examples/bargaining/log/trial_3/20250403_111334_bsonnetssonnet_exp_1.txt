Output message of the LLM:
To initiate the negotiation strategically, I will begin by expressing interest in the pressure washer and make an initial offer that's lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This anchors the negotiation in my favor and leaves room for adjustments. I will also convey a sense of budget constraint to emphasize my purchasing limitations.

Let's start this negotiation.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller expressing my interest in the pressure washer and make an initial offer of $110 to start the negotiation. This allows me some room to adjust, while making the seller consider my opening position. 

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I am interested in the Sun Joe SPX3000 Pressure Washer. Are you open to negotiation?")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=110, side_offer="I have a limited budget for this purchase")

Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! Let's evaluate the situation. The buyer is offering $110, which is significantly lower than our listing price of $169 and also well below our lowest acceptable price of $36.87. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Politely reject the offer and highlight the features and value of the Sun Joe SPX3000 Pressure Washer. 
2. Provide a counteroffer that is closer to our listing price but slightly lower to show some flexibility.
3. Offer to include additional terms, such as free shipping, to make the deal more attractive to the buyer.

I'll execute these steps to strategically negotiate the price.

The seller has countered with an offer of $150 and included free shipping. While this is above my maximum willingness to pay, the inclusion of free shipping adds value. However, I need to bring the price closer to my budget limit while acknowledging the value of the seller's side offer.

Thought: I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one to show flexibility, yet ensure it reflects my budget constraint. I will propose $120 and maintain the notion of a limited budget to reinforce my position. This is still below the seller's offer, but it shows willingness to meet in the middle.

The buyer has increased their offer to $120 and appreciates the free shipping but indicates $120 is their upper limit due to budget constraints. This is still below our listing price but demonstrates willingness to negotiate.

To continue the negotiation and maximize utility:

1. **Acknowledge their budget constraints**: It's important to show understanding and empathy toward their situation.
2. **Counter with a slightly reduced offer**: I'll propose a slightly lower price than the previous offer but higher than their current offer.
3. **Reinforce the product's value**: Highlight its features and emphasize how they represent good value at the proposed price.

The seller has reduced their price to $140, still above my highest acceptable price of $123.43, but maintains the inclusion of free shipping. This indicates their willingness to negotiate, and it presents an opportunity to get closer to my target price.

Thought: I will counter once more by raising my offer slightly to $123. This shows further flexibility on my part, and I will emphasize that it is the maximum I can offer due to my strict budget constraints. This counteroffer approaches the maximum I am willing to pay without exceeding it.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer slightly to $123, maintaining that this is the maximum they can afford. This shows willingness to move closer to a deal, and it's an opportunity to bring the negotiation to a close.

Given that this offer is higher than their previous ones but still below our current counteroffer, I will consider accepting it for the following reasons:

1. **Close the deal**: The buyer appears to be at their maximum budget limit.
2. **Maximize utility within constraints**: $123 is well above our lowest acceptable price of $36.87, providing a reasonable profit margin.
3. **Agreement and relationship**: Concluding the deal positively can ensure a satisfied customer and potentially repeat business or referrals.
