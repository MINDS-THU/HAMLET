Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has expressed interest in the KitchenAid Stand Mixer and made an initial offer of \$300. This offer is significantly lower than my listing price of \$459.99 and provides a utility of only \$159.67 (\$300 - \$140.33). While this is within an acceptable range, I will aim to negotiate a higher price, closer to the listing price, to maximize my utility. 

### Plan:
1. **Send a message**: Acknowledge the buyer's interest and offer, and communicate the value and quality of the stand mixer.
2. **Counter Offer**: Propose a higher price than the buyer's initial offer, keeping in mind the potential for further negotiation.

Thought: I'll acknowledge the buyer's interest, emphasize the mixer's value, and propose a counteroffer closer to the listing price.

Code:
```py
# Send a message to acknowledge buyer's interest and highlight the value of the mixer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the KitchenAid Stand Mixer. It is one of the best in its class with 10 speeds and various attachments. I can consider negotiating the price, but $300 is a bit low for this premium product.")

### Plan:

2. **Highlight the product's premium features** and emphasize value.
3. **Make a new counteroffer** slightly reduced from my previous offer to show goodwill and flexibility.

### Plan:
1. **Acknowledge and appreciate** the buyer's increased offer and express understanding of their budget constraints.
