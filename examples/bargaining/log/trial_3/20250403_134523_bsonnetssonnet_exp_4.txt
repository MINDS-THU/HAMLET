Understanding the buyer's interest in negotiating, I'll start with a firm yet inviting message while presenting the initial offer price. It's essential to anchor high as a seller to allow room for negotiation, but I should also show willingness to negotiate. I'll propose the listing price as the opening offer and communicate the item's premium quality. This approach maximizes the chance of settling at a price above my minimum acceptable price.

Thought: I'll send a message acknowledging the buyer's interest and present a firm opening offer at the listing price, highlighting the item's quality and potential value to the buyer.

This will serve as a counteroffer and a strategy to lead the negotiation to a more feasible price point.
