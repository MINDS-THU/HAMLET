Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I need to respond to the buyer to show openness to negotiation, but also make sure to anchor a reasonable price. I'll reply with a message indicating my willingness to discuss but will also set an initial offer close to the listing price to maintain an advantageous position. This will signal that I am open to negotiation, but also that the product holds significant value.

Code:

This will give me insight into their flexibility and perspective on the price, which I can then use to adjust my strategy accordingly.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has made an initial offer of $175. Since my highest acceptable price is $129.82, I will counter with an offer significantly lower than $129.82 but above an offensively low price. This will leave room for negotiation and show the seller that I'm serious about making a deal. Offering $110 could be a good starting point.

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has offered $110, which is significantly below my initial offer and also below the listing price. This offer is also much closer to my minimum acceptable price of $63.56, but it's important to move through negotiation steps gradually to maximize utility. I'll counter with a moderate concession from my initial offer. This will show I'm willing to negotiate, without giving up too much value too quickly.

Code:
```py
# Counter the buyer's offer with a moderate concession

I should continue to employ a strategy of moderate concessions while emphasizing the value of the product. I'll counter again, coming down a bit from my previous offer to show good faith in the negotiation while protecting my utility.
