Sure, let's work on a response.

### Thought:
The buyer's initial offer of $30.00 is significantly below my lowest acceptable selling price of $46.26, which would result in a negative utility for me. I need to reject this offer while maintaining a positive and professional tone to continue the negotiation process. I'll craft a message emphasizing the value of the product and make a counteroffer closer to the listing price to anchor the negotiation higher.

response_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest! The Withings Body+ scale provides full body composition analysis and other premium features. The offer of $30.00 is too low, but I'm open to negotiation. How about $89.95?")

The buyer has made a small movement upward to $35.00, which is still below my minimum price of $46.26.
