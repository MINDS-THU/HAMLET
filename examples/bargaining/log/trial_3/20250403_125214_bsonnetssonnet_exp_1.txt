### Current Situation
- Buyer's Offer: $700
- Our Listing Price: $1399.99
- Our Minimum Price: $632.76 (any offer below this will result in negative utility)

### Objective
- We must ensure that any offer we accept or propose does not fall below our minimum acceptable price.
- Our goal is to get as close to our listing price as possible to maximize utility.

### Strategy
1. Politely acknowledge the buyer's interest and indicate our willingness to negotiate.
2. Reject the buyer's current offer as it is below our minimum acceptable price.
3. Make a counteroffer significantly closer to our listing price, but slightly lower to show flexibility and encourage further negotiation.

Given their insistence on the $817.24 limit and the potential risk of them walking away, I'll propose a slightly improved offer with an added benefit, like free shipping, to enhance the perceived value without dropping too much on price.
