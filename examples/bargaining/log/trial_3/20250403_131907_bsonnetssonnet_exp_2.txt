Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Starting the negotiation by introducing myself and expressing interest without revealing my bottom line too soon will be a good approach. I will send a message to the seller expressing interest in the fry pan set and also mentioning the idea of exploring potential negotiation.

Thought: I will initiate the negotiation by sending a message to the seller to express interest in the product and inquire about the flexibility in pricing.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the All-Clad Fry Pan Set. Are you open to discussion regarding the price?")

Output message of the LLM:
The initial message expressing interest and inquiring about price flexibility has been sent to the seller. Now, I'll wait for the seller's response before taking the next step.

Thought: I will wait for the seller's response to my initial message to gauge their openness to negotiation before making any offer.

```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer is interested and wants to discuss the price. To start the negotiation, I should express openness to discussion while anchoring slightly below the asking price but above the minimum acceptable price to leave room for negotiation.

I will proceed with the following steps:
1. Send a message expressing openness to negotiate.
2. Make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to gauge the buyer's position and to start the negotiation.

Thought: I will express that I'm open to negotiation and set an opening price slightly below the listing price to initiate the negotiation. This will allow for potential upward negotiation while still leaving room for a deal. 

Code:
```py
# Send a message to respond to the buyer's interest
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! I'm glad to hear you're interested in the All-Clad Fry Pan Set. We can certainly discuss the price.")

Now, I will wait for the buyer's response to my offer. 

Thought: I will wait for the buyer's response to see how they react to my initial offer.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has responded positively to negotiation and proposed a price of $104.99 with free shipping. However, this price is significantly above my maximum willingness to pay, which is $47.4. I need to counter with a considerably lower offer to navigate towards a mutually acceptable price closer to my limit.

### Thought:
I will make a counteroffer significantly below my ceiling to create room for negotiation, starting at $30. This will allow me to present a firm yet negotiable position while keeping within my budget limits.

Step 1

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $30 is significantly below the minimum price I can accept, which is $56.28. It's important to counter this offer with a reasonable explanation and a counteroffer that stays within my acceptable range. I'll aim to emphasize the value of the product and the attractiveness of my offer, perhaps reconsidering the side offer for more appeal.

Thought: I will politely reject the offer while appreciating the buyer's interest. I'll also emphasize the quality and value of the fry pan set, and make a counteroffer closer to my initial offer to maintain reasonable room for negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Reject buyer's offer and provide a counteroffer
response_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your offer, but $30 is well below what I can accept. The All-Clad Fry Pan Set provides exceptional quality and long-lasting durability. Let's try to find a middle ground.")

### Thought:
I will make another counteroffer to bring the price closer to what I am willing to pay. I'll propose $40 and highlight that I'm interested in closing the deal for the right price. This still leaves room for further negotiation towards my maximum limit.

Code:

I will respond by appreciating their new offer and emphasize the added value of the warranty. I will then make another counteroffer, lowering the price slightly but ensuring it's within an acceptable range.

Thought: I'll appreciate the buyer's interest and counter with a price slightly lower, emphasizing the added warranty and quality of the fry pan set, aiming closer to a deal.
