Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will begin the negotiation by reaching out to the seller to express my interest in the ice cream maker and see if they are open to negotiation. I will then make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to start the negotiation while keeping room for further adjustments. This will also give me an understanding of how flexible the seller might be. 

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the Lello 4080 Musso Lussino Ice Cream Maker. Are you open to negotiating on the price?")
print(message)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating the price. I should respond positively to engage the buyer further, establishing an open line for discussion. I should also anchor with a strong initial position by making an offer slightly below the listing price to leave room for negotiation. This also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate without substantially reducing my potential profit.

Code:
```py
# Respond to the buyer's message to indicate readiness to negotiate.
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hi there! I'm glad you are interested in the ice cream maker. I'm open to negotiation. The machine is of high quality and brand new. What price range are you considering?")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has expressed openness to negotiation and provided an initial offer of $980. This is still above my bottomline price of $757.15. I'll make a counteroffer significantly below my bottomline to give us room to negotiate upwards, while also mentioning my budget constraints to apply some pressure.

Thought: The buyer has proposed an offer of $775, which is significantly below my initial offer and the listing price. Although it's a substantial reduction, it's still above my bottomline price of $312.18. I should counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer to maximize utility while making sure to express understanding of the buyer's budget. I can taper my concession to show movement towards compromise.
