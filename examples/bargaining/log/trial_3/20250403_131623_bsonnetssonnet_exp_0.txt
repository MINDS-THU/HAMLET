Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To begin the negotiation, I'll reach out to the seller and express my interest in the item. I'll start by offering a price that's below the maximum I'm willing to pay, allowing room for negotiation. This will also establish a starting point for further discussion.

### Initial Plan:
- Express interest in the item.
- Make an initial offer below my maximum budget to start the negotiation but still reasonable.
- Wait for the seller's response before proceeding with further actions.

Let's start by sending a message and making an offer.

Thought: I will send a message expressing interest and make an initial offer at a reasonable price, lower than the listing price but within negotiation range.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi! I'm interested in The Super Mario Bros. Movie - Power Up Edition 4K Ultra HD. Could we negotiate on the price?")
print(message)

initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=10.99, side_offer=None)
