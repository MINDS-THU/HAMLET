Output message of the LLM:
Sure, I'll initiate the negotiation strategically. I'll start by indicating interest in the item and hint at a budget constraint to set the stage for negotiation. Then I'll make an initial offer, keeping in mind my utility constraints. 

Let's start by sending a message to express interest and introduce a budget statement to establish early boundaries.

Thought: Sending a message to express interest in the item and introduce a potential budget limitation to set the stage for negotiation.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the Samsung T9 Portable SSD 4TB. My budget is somewhat limited, so I'm keen on negotiating a fair price. Are you open to discussion?")

Output message of the LLM:

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Sure! The buyer seems interested and has mentioned having a limited budget. To start, I'll emphasize the value of the product and suggest that I'm open to negotiating within reasonable limits. My goal is to anchor the initial offer close to the listing price while leaving room for negotiation.

Thought: I'll send a message to the buyer to acknowledge their interest and highlight the quality and value of the Samsung T9 Portable SSD. I'll make an initial offer close to the listing price to start the negotiation from a strong position.

Code:
```py
# Send a message highlighting the product's value

Since I've successfully sent a message and made an initial offer at $429.99, I'll wait for the buyer's response. This will allow us to continue the negotiation based on their feedback or counteroffer.

Thought: I'll wait for the buyer to respond to my initial offer or message. This will help me gauge their reaction and formulate my next move based on their reply.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has responded positively to negotiation and provided an initial offer of $429.99, which is significantly above my maximum willingness to pay of $190.55. To steer the negotiation toward a more favorable price, I'll make a counteroffer starting considerably lower than my maximum budget but still within a realistic range to suggest room for negotiation.

Thought: Make a counteroffer starting lower than my maximum budget to foster negotiation and potentially meet the seller at a mutually beneficial price.

Thought: Wait for the seller's response to the counteroffer of $150.00 to understand their negotiation stance and make further decisions accordingly.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $150.00 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $246.35, and accepting it would lead to negative utility. I need to reject this offer and make a counteroffer closer to my acceptable range.

Thought: I will politely reject the buyer's offer as it is too low and doesnâ€™t meet my minimum acceptable price. I need to counter with an offer that is reasonable but still close to my preferred price range. I'll emphasize the value of the SSD again and propose a counteroffer at $399.99.
