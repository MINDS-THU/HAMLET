**Thought:**  
The buyer has shown interest and made an initial offer of $250. While this offer is below my listing price of $299.99, it is still above my minimum acceptable price of $116.69. To maximize my utility, I should counter with a more favorable price closer to the listing price. I will also express the value of the monitor to justify the pricing. This will help anchor the buyer’s expectations higher. I’ll offer the monitor at $285 with potential flexibility, using strategic delay and a friendly message to indicate willingness to negotiate further.

The buyer has lowered their offer to $235, stating a fixed budget but expressing a slight willingness to stretch. This provides an opportunity to negotiate further. Since $235 is significantly below the initial listing price but above the minimum acceptable price, I will consider a slightly lower counteroffer to stimulate progress while emphasizing the monitor’s features.
