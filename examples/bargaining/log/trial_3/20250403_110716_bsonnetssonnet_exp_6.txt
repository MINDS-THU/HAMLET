Output message of the LLM:
Sure, I will start the negotiation process. I will send a message to the seller showing my interest in the item and ask if they are open to negotiation. This will establish contact and open up the floor for further discussion. 

Thought: I will send a message to the seller to express my interest in the DEWALT 20V Max XR Cordless Router and inquire if they are open to negotiation. This will set the stage for potential price discussions.

Code:
```py

Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As I respond to the buyer's interest, my goal is to anchor the negotiation around the value and quality of the DEWALT 20V Max XR Cordless Router. My initial move will be to acknowledge their interest positively while subtly indicating the product's demand and justifying the listing price as competitive. This will set a stage for negotiation while maintaining a firm stance.

Thought: I will send a message acknowledging the buyer's interest and emphasize the quality and value of the product to justify the listing price and initiate the negotiation positively.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for your interest in the DEWALT 20V Max XR Cordless Router.

The seller is open to negotiation and has asked what price I have in mind. Considering my maximum willing price of **165.34**, I'll start with a counteroffer lower than this, giving us room to negotiate upwards but keeping within my acceptable range.
