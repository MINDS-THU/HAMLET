Output message of the LLM:
Sure, I'll initiate the negotiation by expressing interest in the earbuds and starting with an initial offer below the highest price I’m willing to pay. This will give us some room for negotiation.

Let's start the negotiation process.

Thought: I'll send a message to show my interest in the earbuds and make an initial offer below my maximum limit to have room for negotiation. I’ll start at a price of $60 to anchor the negotiation lower.

```py
initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds. Are you open to negotiation?")

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's initial offer of $60 is significantly below both the listing price and the lowest acceptable price of $156.13. Accepting this would yield negative utility, which is not feasible. I need to counter with a price that's closer to the listing price while still leaving room for negotiation. I'll also emphasize the value of the product and how popular it is, potentially implying scarcity to encourage a better offer.

Thought: I will reject the buyer's offer and propose a counteroffer closer to the listing price. I'll highlight the product's high performance and popularity to justify it. 

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has decided to quit the negotiation after receiving my final offer. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach an agreement within my budget constraints.

Thought: Since the negotiation has concluded without reaching a deal, I will finalize my response acknowledging the end of this negotiation round.

Code:
```py
final_response = final_answer(answer="The negotiation has ended without an agreement. The best offer made was $75.16, which was rejected by the seller. The negotiation remains open for future discussions if the seller reconsiders.")
print(final_response)
```
