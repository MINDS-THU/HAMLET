The buyer has made an offer at 200, which is significantly below the lowest acceptable price of 922.78. Accepting this offer would result in a negative utility, which is not an option. I need to counter with a reasonable offer that makes it clear what my expectations are. Since the initial listing price is 1199.99, I will make a counteroffer closer to that price to set an anchor. This will signal to the buyer that my willingness to negotiate starts from a stronger position.

counter_offer_price = 1150  # Setting the initial counteroffer slightly lower than the listing price to show flexibility
