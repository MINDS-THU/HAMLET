Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer has expressed interest and is inquiring about the possibility of negotiating the price. Since there's room for negotiation, I'll start by sending a welcoming message, reinforcing the value of the product, and opening up the possibility of negotiation while anchoring close to the listing price. 

I will then send an initial offer at the listing price, maintaining room to allow for concessions later. 

I'll proceed with this plan. 

```py
# Sending a welcoming message and emphasizing the value of the product
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! 'A Christmas Story (4K UHD)' is indeed a fantastic holiday film and a collector's favorite. While my listing price is $33.99, I'm open to hear what you're considering for this piece.")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller is open to negotiations, which is a positive sign. I will make an initial offer, starting below my maximum budget of $26.85, to allow room for negotiation. I'll propose a price of $22.00, which is a reasonable starting point, and wait for the seller's response.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has proposed an offer of $22.00. Since my listing price was $33.99 and my lowest acceptable price is $6.89, there is room to negotiate, but the offered price is too low for me to accept immediately as it is substantially below the listing.

To proceed strategically, I'll make a counteroffer by slightly reducing my initial offer to signal willingness to negotiate but without giving too much ground initially. Alternatively, I can enhance the offer with a non-monetary value, such as expedited shipping. Let me make a thoughtful counter:

1. Counter the offer at $30.00.
2. Highlight the value of getting a pristine copy of a classic holiday movie.
3. Optionally, I could mention the inclusion of added value like fast shipping to make my counteroffer more attractive.

I will proceed with my plan. 

```py
# Making a counteroffer price lower than the initial listing but emphasizing value, with optional fast shipping
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=30.00, side_offer="Fast shipping included")

Step 1

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller responded with a counteroffer of $30.00 with fast shipping included. While the additional offer of fast shipping adds value, the price is still above my maximum willing price of $26.85. I will counter with a price closer to my maximum, while maintaining room for negotiation. I'll offer $25.00, which might bring us closer to a mutually beneficial deal.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer to $25.00. This is a positive step in the negotiation, showing the buyer's willingness to move towards my asking price. However, I'd like to optimize slightly better while maintaining the negotiation's positive momentum.

Given this, I will:

1. Appreciate their increased offer.
2. Respond with a slightly higher counteroffer, closer to $27-$28, to encourage a little more movement from their side, still emphasizing any additional value like fast shipping.

Let's proceed with a counteroffer at $28.00 and stress the benefits again.

```py
# Making a counter counteroffer close to their offer and emphasizing fast shipping as added value
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=28.00, side_offer="Fast shipping included")

Thought: The seller has countered with a price of $28.00, including fast shipping. This offer is close to my maximum willing price of $26.85, but still slightly higher. To maximize my utility, I can make a final offer that aligns with my highest budget, highlighting that this is my limit. I'll propose a final offer of $26.85.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has further increased their offer to $26.85. This is very close to the last counteroffer I made and demonstrates significant progress in the negotiation.

Given the proximity to my previous offer and considering the value of closing a deal in a competitive negotiation, accepting this offer would yield a solid outcome without risking the momentum we've built.

Since $26.85 provides a utility significantly above my minimum acceptable threshold ($6.89), I will accept this offer to conclude the negotiation favorably.
