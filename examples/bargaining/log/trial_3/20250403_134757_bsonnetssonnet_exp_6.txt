Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To initiate the negotiation, I'll start by reaching out to the seller with a friendly message indicating interest in negotiating the price for the Instant Pot Duo Crisp. Following this, I will make an initial offer below my maximum budget to create room for negotiation. Let's get started.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller to express interest in the item and see if they are open to negotiating the price. This will set the stage for the negotiation and help gauge their willingness to adjust the listing price.

```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the Instant Pot Duo Crisp. Are you open to negotiating the price?")
print(message)

Sure, I'll start by acknowledging the buyer's interest and express my willingness to negotiate, while also emphasizing the Instant Pot Duo Crisp's quality and versatility to maintain a strong initial position.

Thought: I will send a message to the buyer acknowledging interest, highlighting the Instant Pot's features to justify its value, and indicate openness to negotiate starting from the listing price of $199.99.
