Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To initiate the negotiation, I'll start by sending a message to express my interest in the Instant Pot Duo and to subtly probe the seller's flexibility on the price. I'll also make an initial offer that is slightly below my highest acceptable price to leave room for further negotiation.

Thought: I'll send a message to express my interest in the product and suggest that I'm open to negotiation, then I'll make an initial offer to kickstart the negotiation process.

Code:
```py

print(message)

initial_offer_price = 50.00  # A starting point below my maximum to allow room for negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has proposed a price of $50 with a side offer of a quick purchase. This amount is above my lowest acceptable price of $43.02, but there's room for negotiation to improve the deal.

### Negotiation Strategy:
1. **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a slightly higher price than the buyer's offer to improve my utility while keeping the buyer engaged.
2. **Highlight Product Value:** Emphasize the quality and versatility of the Instant Pot to justify my counteroffer.
3. **Leverage Quick Purchase:** Acknowledge the buyer's readiness to make a quick decision and use it to create urgency while maintaining a higher price point.

I'll proceed with crafting a counteroffer at $80.99 to balance between securing a deal and maximizing profit.

```py
# Make a counteroffer to the buyer with emphasis on product value and readiness for quick purchase.
counter_offer_price = 80.99
side_offer_with_message = "This Instant Pot Duo offers exceptional value with its multiple functionalities. I'm pleased to offer it at $80.99 for a quick purchase."

Thought: I'll make a counteroffer closer to my maximum acceptable price to show willingness to negotiate, but still stay within my utility range. I'll also emphasize my readiness for a quick transaction to incentivize the seller.

Code:

### Negotiation Strategy:
1. **Continue Negotiating:** I will make another counteroffer, slightly lowering my previous price to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable outcome.
2. **Value Reminder:** I will continue to emphasize the value and versatility of the Instant Pot.
3. **Acknowledge Quick Purchase:** Align with the buyer's willingness for a quick purchase to add urgency.

I will now counteroffer at $70.99.

2. **Show Flexibility:** Acknowledge their budget limit while emphasizing the value of the product.
