Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the seller, I should start with a strong and assertive opening by proposing a price above my bottomline to leave room for negotiation. I'll also emphasize the unique value of the Blu-Ray and Digital set to justify the price.

**Code:**
```py
# Sending a message to the buyer along with an initial offer.
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! 'Flash, The (Blu-Ray + Digital)' is an exciting movie with a lot of bonus content that fans will love. Considering its popularity and additional features, I would value it at $25. How does that sound?")

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's offer of $25 is below my bottomline of $31.81, but I aim to negotiate for a lower price to maximize my utility. I will make a counteroffer significantly below the seller's price to establish a negotiation range and provide room for concessions.

Code:

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has offered $15, which is below my initial offer but still gives me a positive utility of \(15 - 10.06 = 4.94\). There is room for negotiation, so I should make a counteroffer slightly above $15 to try and maximize my utility while ensuring I stay engaged in the negotiation process.

**Code:**
```py

Output message of the LLM:
I've made a counteroffer of $20 to the buyer. This allows room to continue negotiation while maximizing my utility potential. I'll now wait for the buyer's response.

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has reduced their price to $20. This is an improvement, but there's still room to negotiate for a better deal. I'll make a slightly higher counteroffer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still aiming to maximize my utility.

Code:
```py
# Make a counteroffer closer to the seller's new offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=17, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to $17. While this is below my counteroffer of $20, it still provides a positive utility of \(17 - 10.06 = 6.94\). To push for a bit more but not lose the deal, I should reduce my counter slightly and aim for a middle ground.

**Code:**
```py
# Making another counteroffer slightly lower than the previous offer to facilitate closing the deal
