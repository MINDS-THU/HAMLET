Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As a buyer, my strategy is to kick off the negotiation with a low anchor offer that provides me with ample room for negotiation. I will make an initial offer significantly lower than my bottomline to establish my starting point.

**Thought:** I will make an initial offer to purchase the BISSELL Little Green Pro for $80. This offer is well below my maximum budget limit, providing room for negotiation while still being reasonable for initial discussions.

**Code:**
```py
# Making an initial offer of $80 for the item
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=80, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
# Making an initial offer of $80 for the item
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=80, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
======== buyer ========
Execution logs:A new offer has been sent.
Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The initial offer of $80 has been sent to the seller. Now, I'll wait for the seller's response to see how they react to this offer.

**Thought:** Since I've made an offer, I'll wait for the seller's response before deciding on the next steps.

**Code:**
```py
# Waiting for the seller's response to the initial offer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
# Waiting for the seller's response to the initial offer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $80 is well above my bottomline of $34.4, so accepting it would result in a positive utility of $80 - $34.4 = $45.6. This is a strong offer and is advantageous.

**Thought:** I want to accept this offer since it provides a good utility beyond my bottomline. 

**Code:**
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
print(response)
```
======== seller ========
Executing parsed code:
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
print(response)
======== seller ========
Execution logs:A response to the offer has been sent.
Out: None
======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The offer has been successfully accepted. The negotiation is concluded with an agreement at a selling price of $80, which provides a substantial positive utility.
