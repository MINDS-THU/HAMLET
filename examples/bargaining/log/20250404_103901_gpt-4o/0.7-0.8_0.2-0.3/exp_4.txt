======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Sure, let's start the negotiation process for the Shark HD430 FlexStyle Air Styling & Drying System. I'll begin by sending a message to express interest and request the initial price from the seller. 

Thought: I want to express my interest in the item and request the seller’s initial price to anchor the negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Sending a message to the seller to express interest and ask for the starting price
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in the Shark HD430 FlexStyle Air Styling & Drying System. Could you let me know your starting price for it?")
print(message)
```

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
I have sent a message to the seller expressing interest in the Shark HD430 FlexStyle Air Styling & Drying System and asked for their starting price. Now, I'll wait for their response.

Thought: It's best to wait for the seller's response to see their initial price before proceeding with our negotiation strategy.

Code:
```py
# Waiting for the seller's response regarding the starting price
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I should start with a firm initial price that is above my bottomline to allow room for negotiation. This will also give an impression of the item's value and quality. I'll propose a starting price of $110 to begin the negotiation, emphasizing the product's quality and versatility.

Code:
```py
# Send a message and make the initial offer to the buyer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! The Shark HD430 FlexStyle is an excellent choice—it's both powerful and versatile. My starting price for it is $110.")

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has provided an initial offer of $110, which is well below our bottomline of $225.63. This gives us a good starting point, but I will aim to negotiate the price even lower to maximize our utility.

Thought: I'll counter with a lower offer to maximize the negotiation space further and create room for potential concessions from the seller.

Code:
```py
# Making a counteroffer with a lower price to maximize our utility
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=90, side_offer=None)

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
I have made a counteroffer of $90 to the seller. Now, I'll wait for their response to see if they'll agree to our proposed price or make another counteroffer.

Thought: It's important to wait for the seller's response to our counteroffer before taking any further steps in the negotiation.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has made a counteroffer of $90. This is below my initial offer but above my bottomline of $68.37. It's an acceptable range for further negotiation, but I should try to get the price higher to maximize my utility. I'll make a counteroffer at $100 to show some flexibility while still aiming to get a better deal.

Code:
```py
# Counter the buyer's offer with a price of $100
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=100, side_offer=None)

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has countered with an offer of $100. This is still a good price below our bottomline, but there's potential to negotiate further down to increase our utility.

Thought: I'll propose a slightly lower offer to see if the seller can go down a bit more, while still being within a reasonable range for negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Making another counteroffer at a slightly lower price to improve our utility
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=95, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
I have made a new counteroffer of $95 to the seller. Now, let's wait for the seller's response to see if they accept our price or present another counteroffer.

Thought: It's essential to wait and see how the seller responds to our new counteroffer to determine our next steps in the negotiation process.

Code:
```py
# Waiting for the seller's response to the new counteroffer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $95. This is a reasonable increment and it's relatively close to my recent counteroffer of $100. Accepting this offer would ensure a positive utility for me. I'll accept this offer to secure a deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation.
