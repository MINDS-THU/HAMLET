======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
As the buyer, I will start the negotiation with a low initial offer to establish negotiation leverage. I'll open with a price significantly below my bottomline to allow room for adjustment. A friendly opening message will set the tone for negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
# Sending an opening message and making a low initial offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing '2001: A Space Odyssey' [4K UHD]. Could we discuss the price?")
print(message)

initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=8.00, side_offer=None)

I have successfully initiated the negotiation by sending a message and an initial offer. Now, I need to wait for the response from the seller to see how they react to my offer.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has proposed a price of 8.0, which is significantly above my bottomline of 4.52. This provides a good opportunity to negotiate effectively and maximize my utility. I'll start by making a counteroffer that's reasonably higher, allowing room for potential future concessions, while highlighting the unique value of the product.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer slightly above the buyer's offer.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=10.0, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have made a counteroffer at a price of 10.0. I'll now wait for the buyer's response to see if they accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. This will guide my next move in the negotiation process.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
The seller has countered with a price of $10.00, which is below my bottomline of $13.74. This is a positive development, but I should try to negotiate an even lower price to maximize my utility. I'll make a counteroffer slightly below the seller's current offer to see if I can secure a better deal.

**Code:**
```py
# Making a counteroffer slightly below the seller's current offer to maximize my utility

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has responded with a counteroffer of 9.0, which is still above my bottomline. While this price is acceptable, I can attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize utility. I'll counter with a small concession to 9.5, reinforcing the product's value.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
The seller has reduced the price to $9.50, bringing the offer closer to my target. Although this price is quite favorable, further negotiation may reduce it slightly more. I'll make a final counteroffer of $9.25 to see if the seller is willing to accept it.
