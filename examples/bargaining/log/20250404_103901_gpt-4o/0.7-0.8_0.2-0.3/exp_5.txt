Output message of the LLM:
To start the negotiation, I will open with a low initial offer to establish a strong negotiation position. This will give me room to make concessions if needed while still aiming to secure a favorable deal below my bottomline.

**Thought:** I'll start the negotiation by expressing my interest in the item and offering $6.50 as a starting point.

**Code:**
```py
# Sending a message to express interest and making an initial low offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the FURemover Pet Hair Rubber Broom. I'd like to start with an offer of $6.50.")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has offered $6.50, which is significantly above my bottomline of $2.81. However, I want to aim for a higher utility if possible. I'll counter with a higher price and justify it by highlighting the unique features and benefits of the broom.

**Code:**
```py
# Send a message to the buyer explaining why the price is justified and make a counter-offer.
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your offer! The FURemover Pet Hair Rubber Broom is a unique multi-purpose tool with unmatched efficiency in pet hair removal, even beating expensive vacuums. Considering its quality and demand, my offer is $15.00.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller countered with an offer of $15, which is well above my bottomline of $9.53. I need to negotiate this price down significantly while highlighting budget constraints and market options.

**Thought:** I'll express appreciation for the response and explain that $15 is beyond my budget. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, at $7.00, to show willingness to move closer to an agreement.

**Code:**
```py
# Responding to the seller's offer with a counter offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Thank you for your response, but $15.00 is out of my budget. How about we consider $7.00?")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer slightly to $7.00. While this provides a good utility, there's still room to negotiate for a better price. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer to show a willingness to negotiate, while still aiming to increase my utility.

**Code:**

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has come down to $12.00, which is still above my bottomline of $9.53. I'll need to bring the price down further while maintaining a cooperative tone.

**Thought:** I'll thank the seller for their flexibility and make another counteroffer at $8.00, suggesting that I'm still constrained by budget but showing increment in my offers to reach a middle ground.
