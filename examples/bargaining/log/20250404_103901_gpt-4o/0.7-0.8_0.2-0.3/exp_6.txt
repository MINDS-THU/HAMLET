Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I will start the negotiation by making an assertive but low initial offer to establish negotiation leverage. My goal is to negotiate well below my bottomline of 22.02. I'll offer $12 as a starting point and mention budget constraints to set the tone.

**Code:**
```py
# Make an initial offer to start the negotiation.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=12, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have made an initial offer of $12. Now I will wait for the seller's response to the offer before proceeding with the next step in the negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
# Wait for the response from the seller to the initial offer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has proposed a price of 12, which provides good utility since my bottomline is 7.02. However, I should aim to negotiate for a better deal by making a counteroffer slightly higher, in order to maximize my utility. Let's propose a higher price while leaving room for potential concessions.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer to the buyer with a higher price to negotiate a better deal
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=15, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for the buyer's response to the counteroffer
wait = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")
print(wait)

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has made a counteroffer of $15, which is quite reasonable and much below my bottomline of $22.02. However, since my goal is to get the best possible deal, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there's room to improve the price further. I'll offer $13 and remind the seller of my budget constraints.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer slightly below the seller's offer to improve the deal.
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=13, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
# Make a counteroffer slightly below the seller's offer to improve the deal.
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=13, side_offer=None)

Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have made a counteroffer of $13. Now, I will wait for the seller's response to see if they accept my offer or propose another one.

**Code:**
```py
# Wait for the seller's response to the counteroffer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
# Wait for the seller's response to the counteroffer.

print(response)
======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to 13. This is still within an acceptable range but slightly below my previous counteroffer. Since the difference is not substantial and taking into consideration maximizing utility, accepting this offer provides a good balance between utility and closing the deal promptly.

**Code:**
```py
# Accept the offer from the buyer since it provides a positive utility and promptly closes the deal
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
print(response)
```
======== seller ========
Executing parsed code:
# Accept the offer from the buyer since it provides a positive utility and promptly closes the deal
