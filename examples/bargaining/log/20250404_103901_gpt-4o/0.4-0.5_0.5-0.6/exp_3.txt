======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! In this negotiation, my primary objective is to secure a deal significantly below my bottomline of $13.95. I will begin by making a low initial offer to establish a strong position in the negotiation.

Thought: I'll begin by expressing interest in the item and making a low initial offer to anchor the negotiation. I'll use a strategy of setting my initial offer at $8.00, which provides ample room for negotiation and is quite below my maximum budget. This will allow me to maneuver and potentially secure the item at a favorable price.
 
Code:
```py
# Start the negotiation with an expression of interest and low initial offer
initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in 'The Dark Crystal [4K UHD + Blu-ray]'. I would like to make an initial offer of $8.00. Let me know if this works for you.")
print(initial_message)

Output message of the LLM:
Considering my bottomline of $18.21, the buyer's offer of $8.00 is not acceptable as it would result in a negative utility. I will reject the offer and then provide a counteroffer at a reasonable price above my bottomline to initiate the negotiation process effectively.

**Thought:** The buyer's initial offer is too low. I will reject it and make a counteroffer at a higher price to encourage negotiation.

# Reject the buyer's initial offer.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has rejected my initial offer and countered with a price of $25.00, which is significantly above my bottomline of $13.95. My goal remains to negotiate a price well below my maximum. 

Thought: Since the seller's offer is much higher than my limit, I need to counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial $8.00, but still well below my bottomline. I will make a counteroffer at $10.00 and mention that it's a fair price given market conditions.

The buyer's new offer of $10.00 is still below my bottomline of $18.21, resulting in negative utility. I will need to reject this offer once again and continue negotiating by making a counteroffer closer to our optimal range.

**Thought:** The buyer's new offer is still too low. I will reject it and propose another counteroffer that is reasonable yet firm to convey the value of the product.
