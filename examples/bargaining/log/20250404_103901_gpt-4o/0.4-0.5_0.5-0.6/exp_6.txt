Output message of the LLM:
Sure, I will start the negotiation by expressing my interest in the item and setting up a context for a potential low starting offer. This will set the tone for further negotiation. 

**Thought:** To begin the negotiation, I will send a message expressing my interest in the item and ask for the sellerâ€™s starting price. This will help in understanding the seller's expectations before making an initial offer from my side.

**Code:**
```py

Before responding to the buyer, I'll select a strong yet reasonable starting price that allows room for negotiation, ensuring my starting price maximizes potential profit while considering my bottomline of $101.87. 

**Thought:** I will set the starting price at $150. This price is above my bottomline and leaves room for negotiation, while also providing the buyer with a quality product at a competitive market price.

**Code:**
