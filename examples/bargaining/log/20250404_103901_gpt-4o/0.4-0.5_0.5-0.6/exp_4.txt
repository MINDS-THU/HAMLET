Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will start by sending a message expressing interest in the item and ask for the seller's starting price. This will help establish the starting point for our negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
Sure! I'll start by responding with a firm opening offer that allows me room to negotiate but is above my bottomline.

**Thought:** I need to open with a strong offer that emphasizes the quality and value of the DASH Safe Slice Mandoline Slicer. Starting just above the lowest acceptable price allows me room to negotiate if needed. 

**Code:**
```py

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's starting price of $49.99 is significantly above my bottomline of $22.06. I need to counter with a much lower offer to begin negotiations closer to my acceptable range. This initial counteroffer will be low to create space for negotiation.

The buyer's offer of $15.00 is well below my bottomline of $29.96. I need to reject this offer and possibly make a counteroffer while emphasizing the product's value and unique features to justify my price.

**Thought:** Politely reject the given offer since it's below my bottomline and make a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price. Reiterate the value and demand of the DASH Safe Slice Mandoline Slicer.
