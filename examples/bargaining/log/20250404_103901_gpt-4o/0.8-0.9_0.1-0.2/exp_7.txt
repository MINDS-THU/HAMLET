Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, I need to start the negotiation with a low initial offer to establish a strong position. My goal is to eventually secure a deal well below my bottomline of 28.39. I should mention potential budget constraints to help anchor the seller to a lower price range.

**Code:**
```py
# Send an initial message to initiate negotiation and express interest, asking for the seller's initial price.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in purchasing 'Godzilla vs. Kong (4K Ultra HD)'. What price are you willing to start the negotiation at?")

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have initiated the negotiation by expressing my interest in the item and asking for the seller's starting price. Now, I should wait for the seller to respond before deciding on the next steps.

**Code:**

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've sent an initial offer with a price of 25.0. Now, I will wait for the buyer's response to see how they will counter or react to this offer.

**Code:**
```py
# Waiting for the buyer's response to the initial offer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")
print(response)

======== seller ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller's initial offer is 25.0, which is below my bottomline of 28.39 and provides me with a positive utility. However, my objective is to negotiate a deal well below this limit. I can counter with a lower offer to continue the negotiation process and aim for a better price.

**Code:**
```py
# Counter the seller's offer with a lower price to maximize my utility
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=20.0, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)
```

Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have successfully countered with an offer of 20.0. Now, I should wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to come down to this level or counter with another offer. This will inform my next steps in adjusting the negotiation strategy.

**Code:**
```py
# Wait for the seller's response to my counter-offer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has countered with an offer of 20.0, which is still above my bottomline, allowing room for negotiation. I can counter this with a strategically higher offer that is more acceptable to me, while still being attractive to the buyer. I'll propose 22.5 to bridge the gap between the offers.

**Code:**
```py
# Send a counteroffer to the buyer that is more favorable to my position
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=22.5, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)
```

======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has reduced their offer to 22.5, which is better for me but still above my counteroffer of 20.0. This indicates some willingness on their part to lower the price further. I could counter slightly higher than my last offer to see if I can achieve a compromise closer to my target price.

**Code:**
```py
# Make another counter offer slightly higher than the last one to continue negotiations
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=21.0, side_offer=None)

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've now made a counter-offer of 21.0. I should wait again for the seller's response. If the seller accepts, it would be a favorable deal. If not, I may need to see how close they are willing to come to my current offer, or if necessary, adjust my strategy.

======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to 21.0. Since this is closer to my last offer, I can choose to accept it considering it's above my bottomline and gives me good utility, or make another slight counter-offer closer to 22.0 to test their acceptance.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a final counteroffer slightly below my previous one to see if the buyer will agree
final_counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=21.5, side_offer=None)

Execution logs:A new offer has been sent.
Out: None
======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've made a final counteroffer at 21.5, which is a reasonable amount considering the negotiation progress. Now, I'll wait for the buyer's response to see if they accept the offer, counter again, or perhaps finalize at this price.

**Code:**
```py
# Waiting for the buyer's response to the final counteroffer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")
print(response)

======== seller ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has countered with a price of 21.5, which is very close to my previous offer of 21. This indicates they may be nearing their bottomline or acceptable limit. Since the price of 21.5 still provides utility below my maximum limit, it may be strategic to accept this offer.

**Code:**
```py
# Accept the seller's offer of 21.5 as it provides a positive utility.
accept_offer = respond_to_offer(agent_name="buyer", response=True)
print(accept_offer)

Output message of the LLM:
I have accepted the seller's offer of 21.5, which secures a favorable deal well below my bottomline. This provides me with a positive utility.
