Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** Since I'm the buyer, I will open the negotiation with a strong and low initial offer to create room for negotiation. This approach will set a benchmark that pushes the negotiation towards a favorable outcome for me.

**Code:**
```py
# Start the negotiation with a low initial offer.
initial_offer_price = 20  # Open with a low offer
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=initial_offer_price, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I have successfully sent an initial low offer to start the negotiation. Now, I need to wait for the seller's response to see how they react to my proposal, which will guide my next steps in the negotiation process.

**Code:**
```py
# Wait for the seller's response to my initial offer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has made an offer of $20, which is significantly higher than my bottomline of $5.43. This offer provides a good utility for me. However, to maximize my utility, it would be beneficial to make a counteroffer to see if I can achieve an even better price. I should remember to maintain a friendly but firm position to justify my value. I will make a counteroffer at a slightly higher price. 

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer slightly above the buyer's offer to maximize utility.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=22, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```

======== seller ========
Executing parsed code:
# Make a counteroffer slightly above the buyer's offer to maximize utility.

======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've made a counteroffer at $22. Now, I need to await the buyer's response to see if they are willing to accept or further negotiate. Patience is key in this phase, as waiting might help exert subtle pressure without overt coercion.

**Code:**
```py
# Wait for the buyer's response to my counteroffer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")
print(response)
```
======== seller ========

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has countered with an offer slightly higher than my initial offer. I should consider making a mild counteroffer to continue negotiations and move the price further towards my target, while still maintaining good negotiation leverage.

**Code:**
```py
# Counter with a slightly increased offer but still below the seller's current offer.
counter_offer_price = 21  # Gradually moving closer but still below the seller's counter
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=counter_offer_price, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've made a counteroffer of $21, which is a little higher than my initial offer but still below the seller's previous offer of $22. Now, I need to wait for the seller's response to see if they'll accept or propose another counteroffer.

# Wait for the seller's response to my counteroffer.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to $21, which is quite close to my counteroffer of $22. Accepting this offer would give me a solid utility above my bottomline and is only a slight concession from my last price. Since the change in their offer reflects a genuine interest and willingness to negotiate, it might be advantageous to close the deal here.

**Code:**
```py
# Accept the buyer's offer of $21 since it provides a good utility.
accept_offer = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
