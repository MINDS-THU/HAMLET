Thought: To initiate the negotiation effectively, I will start by expressing interest in the item and ask for the seller's initial asking price. This will help me understand their starting point and give me a baseline from which to negotiate.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the seller, I need to start with a strong opening price above my bottomline to leave room for negotiation. I'll justify this price by highlighting the vacuum's advanced features and high demand.

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for your interest.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's starting price of $150 is significantly below my bottomline of $422.85, which gives me ample room to negotiate for an even better deal. Even though $150 is already a favorable offer, I can attempt to negotiate a lower price by proposing an initial counteroffer to gauge their flexibility.
