Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation as a buyer, I will start with a low initial offer to create some negotiation space. This will allow me to potentially secure a deal well below my bottomline. I will communicate my initial offer and express interest in purchasing the BowFlex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell.

Code:
```py
# Start the negotiation with a low initial offer
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=120, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Send a message to express interest in the item
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello, I'm interested in purchasing the BowFlex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell. I would like to start with an offer of $120.")

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's initial offer of $120 is significantly below my bottomline of $28.23. I need to make a counteroffer that leaves room for negotiation but is closer to my target price.

### Thought:
- I'll make a counteroffer at a higher price than my bottomline to allow room for concessions.
- Use precise pricing to signal seriousness in negotiations.
- Highlight the product benefits in my message to justify the price.

### Code:
```py
# Send a message to the buyer and make a counteroffer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the BowFlex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell. This product offers incredible value with six different weights combined into one compact design, perfect for efficient home workouts. Considering its versatility and market demand, I can offer it at $200.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's offer of $200 is above my bottomline of $161.13, so I cannot accept it. I should make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my initial offer to signal a willingness to negotiate, but still far below my maximum limit. This will help me move closer to an acceptable deal without reaching my bottomline.

Code:
```py
# Make a counteroffer that is higher than the initial offer but still below my bottomline
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=130, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer to $130. While this is an improvement, it still does not align with my expectations. I'll make a counteroffer closer to their current offer but remain within the bounds of maximizing my utility.

### Thought:
- I'll make a counteroffer that is lower than my previous but still provides room for negotiation, ideally moving toward an agreeable price.
- Reinforce the value and demand of the product in the justification message to continue the negotiation positively.

### Code:
```py
# Send a message to the buyer and make a new counteroffer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="I appreciate your revised offer. The BowFlex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell is a highly sought-after item due to its versatility and space-saving design. I can lower my offer to $180, as this ensures both parties receive good value.")

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased the offer to $140. This shows progress, but there's still room to negotiate toward a better price. I'll slightly reduce my offer again while emphasizing the quality and value of the product to justify it.

- Highlight the premium quality and distinguish the product's unique features to support my pricing strategy.
