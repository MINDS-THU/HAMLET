Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! Let's start with an assertive opening offer that provides room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit.

**Thought:** I will propose a starting price well above my bottomline to leave room for negotiation. This will allow me to make concessions and still stay above the minimum acceptable price.

**Code:**
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=290, side_offer="The processor is in high demand so this is a good offer considering the market value.")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's initial offer of $290 is significantly above my maximum budget of $201.26. I will counter with a much lower offer, well below my budget, to start the negotiation process. This will allow me room to make concessions if necessary.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's counteroffer of $150 is significantly below my bottomline of $34.56, and thus, accepting it would lead to a negative utility. I need to make a counteroffer closer to my starting position, while being slightly more competitive to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Thought:** I will counter with a more reasonable offer, reducing from my initial price but still maintaining a healthy margin above my bottomline.

**Code:**
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=250, side_offer="This price reflects the premium quality and popularity of the processor.")

The buyer has increased their offer to $190, indicating they are eager to reach a middle ground. While this is still below my last offer, it's in the right direction. However, I need to negotiate closer to a satisfactory margin.
