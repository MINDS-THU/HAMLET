Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As a buyer, I should start the negotiation by expressing interest in the product and inquiring about the seller's initial price. This will help me understand their pricing strategy and give me room to negotiate.

message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in the Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor. Could you let me know your starting price?")

Certainly. I will start with a strong opening offer that is above my bottomline to leave room for negotiation. I will also highlight the unique features of the product to justify the price.

Thought: I will propose an initial price above my bottomline and emphasize the product's unique features and market value to justify it.

Code:
```py
# Send an opening message and make an initial offer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! The Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor is a great device that helps you easily understand and track the quality of your indoor air. It's currently available for $20.99.")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's offer of $20.99 is well below my bottomline of $56.35, which is a favorable starting point for me. However, to maximize my utility, I can attempt to negotiate an even lower price. I will counter with a lower offer and emphasize my budget constraints.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has proposed an offer of $15.00. This price is above my bottomline of $8.14, but I want to negotiate to maximize my utility. To remain strategic, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial price, emphasizing the product's value.

Thought: I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, mentioning the device's features to justify the value. This will help maximize my utility while moving towards a deal.

Code:
```py
