======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As the buyer, I should start the negotiation by sending a polite message to express interest in the item. This will help set the stage for discussing the price. I'll then make a low initial offer to maximize my negotiation leverage.

Code:
```py
# Sending a message to express interest in the item
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the 8Bitdo Sn30 Pro Bluetooth Controller. Could you let me know the starting price?")
print(message)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Having expressed interest in the item with my initial message, I should now wait for the seller's response. This will provide me with a starting point for discussing the price.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As the seller, I will start by proposing a strong initial offer, above my bottomline, to leave room for negotiation and maximize my utility.

**Thought:** I will propose an initial price that offers room for negotiation while being attractive enough to draw interest from the buyer.

**Code:**
```py
# Send an initial offer to the buyer for the 8Bitdo Sn30 Pro Bluetooth Controller.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=30.00, side_offer=None)

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has offered a price of $30.0, which is below my bottomline of $40.44, meaning I would have positive utility if I accept this offer. However, my goal is to negotiate a deal well below my bottomline to maximize my utility. I should make a counteroffer and aim for a lower price.

Code:
```py
# Making a counteroffer to the seller with a lower price
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=20.0, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)
```
======== buyer ========

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have sent a counteroffer to the seller with a lower price of $20.0. Now, I should wait for the seller's response to see if they accept my offer or come back with another counteroffer.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $20.00 is significantly lower than my initial proposal and leaves ample room for continued negotiation. As the seller, I need to counter with a more favorable price for myself, while still appearing reasonable to maintain the buyer's interest.

**Thought:** I'll make a counteroffer, reducing the price slightly to encourage further negotiations but still aiming to maximize my utility.

**Code:**
```py
# Counter the buyer's offer with a slightly lower price than my initial offer.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=27.50, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with a price of $27.5, which is still below my bottomline and represents positive utility. However, I might be able to secure a better deal by negotiating further. I should make another counteroffer slightly lower than their proposal to test their willingness to negotiate.

Code:

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's new offer of $25.00 is a step closer to my counteroffer. To continue negotiations constructively, I can propose a price that brings us closer to a potential agreement without compromising too much on my utility.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has now proposed a price of $26.5. This is a reasonable price below my bottomline, resulting in positive utility. It seems I've reached a point close to the seller's minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might not yield significantly lower offers.
