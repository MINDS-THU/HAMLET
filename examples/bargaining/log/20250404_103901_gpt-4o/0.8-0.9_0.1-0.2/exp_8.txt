Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's initial offer of $250.0 is significantly below my maximum budget of $816.96, which provides a great opportunity to negotiate further. However, to maximize my utility, I should aim for an even lower price. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the seller's initial price to see if they are willing to reduce the price further.
