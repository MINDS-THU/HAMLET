Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I need to start the negotiation with an initial offer that is significantly below my bottomline to create room for negotiation. This will allow me to gauge the seller's willingness to negotiate and their pricing expectations.

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=150, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Given the buyer's initial offer of 150, we should consider our own bottomline of 52.9. This offer is above our bottomline, but we should aim to maximize our utility by negotiating for a higher price. I'll proceed by responding with a counteroffer that leaves room for future concessions.

### Current Situation:
- **Buyer's offer:** 150
- **Bottomline (lowest acceptable price):** 52.9
- **Target strategy:** Aim for a higher price to maximize utility.

### Next Steps:
- I'll make a counteroffer with a higher price and emphasize the unique value of the product.

**Thought:** I will make a counteroffer with a price above 150, ideally starting high to leave room for negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer to the buyer
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=250, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for buyer's response

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has made a counteroffer at $250, which is below my bottomline, but I aim to secure a deal well below that. I will make a counteroffer at $200 to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price before I decide on the sellerâ€™s offer.

Code:
```py
# Make a counteroffer at $200 to continue negotiating for a better price.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=200, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for the seller's response to my counteroffer.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has raised their offer to 200, which shows they're willing to negotiate up. This price is still above my bottomline, but I'll attempt to negotiate for an even better price to maximize my utility further. I will propose a slightly higher counteroffer to maintain some room for potential concessions while moving closer to an agreement.

**Thought:** I'll make a counteroffer slightly above the buyer's current offer, encouraging them to meet at a higher price.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer to the buyer
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=225, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for the buyer's response
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has reduced the price to $225, which is a better offer than before. However, I can try to negotiate slightly lower to maximize my utility. I will make a final counteroffer at $210, which is still below my bottomline and shows that I'm nearing my limit, to see if the seller is willing to accept it.

Code:
```py
# Make a final counteroffer at $210 to see if the seller will accept it.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=210, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer to 210, which is a positive sign. As we're getting closer to an agreement, I should consider how far I want to settle above my bottomline to maximize utility. However, I still want to aim for a bit more, and 15 units remain between my last offer and their current one.

**Thought:** I'll make a new counteroffer at a slightly lower price than before but still higher than the buyer's current offer, potentially encouraging them to meet in the middle.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a counteroffer to the buyer
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=220, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller is holding firm at $220. This is still below my budget ceiling of $299.23 and represents a fair compromise. It would be wise to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction and maximize utility below my bottomline.
