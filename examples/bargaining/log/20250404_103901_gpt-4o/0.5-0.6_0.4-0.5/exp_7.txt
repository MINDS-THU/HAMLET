Output message of the LLM:
Sure, let's kick off the negotiation with a strong and assertive opening offer. I'll aim to set a low initial price to establish a good starting point for the negotiation.

**Thought:** I'm going to make an initial low offer to establish negotiation leverage and show interest in the product, while signaling my budget constraints.

**Code:**
```py
# Send an initial low offer to start the negotiation and establish a range.
initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=750, side_offer="Fast payment upon agreement")
print(initial_offer)

# Wait for the seller's response to the initial offer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made an offer of $750 with the side perk of fast payment. Since my bottomline is $816.86, accepting this offer would result in negative utility for me. Therefore, I must reject this offer and propose a counteroffer higher than this amount but still reasonable enough to continue the negotiation.

**Thought:** I need to reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to the market value of this high-quality camera while considering the fast payment perk as a reasonable advantage. I'll also reference the camera's advanced features to justify a higher price.

**Code:**
```py
# Reject the current offer since it results in negative utility,
# then make a counteroffer closer to a profitable range considering the quality of the camera.
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

# Making a counteroffer above the bottomline and emphasizing the camera's quality.
counter_offer_price = 900  # This price is a strategic midpoint, allowing future negotiations.

Output message of the LLM:
I have successfully rejected the buyer's initial offer of $750, as it would have led to negative utility for me. I made a counteroffer of $900, emphasizing the camera's sophisticated features and market demand to justify the proposed price. Now, I will wait for the buyer's response.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has countered with a price of \$900, which is above my initial offer but still significantly below my bottom line of \$1081.83. I can make a counter-offer closer to their latest proposal, further utilizing negotiation flexibilities to maximize utility.

**Thought:** I'll counter with an offer slightly below the seller's offer to keep negotiations active while aiming to lower the final price towards my target.

**Code:**
```py
# Counter with a slightly lower offer to the seller's proposal and keep the negotiation active.
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=820, side_offer="Immediate payment upon agreement")

Accepting this offer achieves my goal of securing a deal with positive utility while ensuring prompt payment.

**Thought:** The offer of $820 provides a positive utility, and the side perk of immediate payment adds value to the deal. It is strategic to accept this offer to close the negotiation favorably.

**Code:**
```py
# Accept the buyer's offer since it results in a positive utility and includes immediate payment.
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
