======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will start with a low opening offer to establish a strong negotiating position. This will give me room to make concessions later if needed. I'll make an initial offer of $70 for the item.

# Making a low initial offer to establish negotiation leverage
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=70, side_offer=None)

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's initial offer is \$70, which is below my bottomline of \$93.05. I cannot accept this offer as it would lead to negative utility. I should make a counteroffer that is above my bottomline while still providing room for negotiation.

My strategy is to start with an assertive offer that emphasizes the quality and demand for the SSD. I'll remind the buyer of the exceptional performance and reliability of the product, which justifies a higher price, and make a counteroffer of \$130.

Thought: I'll counter the buyer's offer with a reasonable price that reflects the SSD's value and quality, starting at \$130 to see if the buyer is willing to come closer to my acceptable range.

```py
# Send a message and propose a counteroffer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="The SAMSUNG 870 EVO SSD is known for its high performance and reliability. Given its value, I can offer it to you for $130.")
print(message)

I've sent the counteroffer of $130 to the buyer. Now, I will wait for their response.

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's offer of $130 is above my bottomline of $120.54, which means I cannot accept it. I should counteroffer with a slightly higher price than my initial offer but still below my bottomline to continue the negotiation and try to reach an acceptable agreement.

Code:
```py
# Counteroffering with a price slightly higher than my initial offer
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=85, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:

I've sent a counteroffer of $115 to the buyer, emphasizing the value and benefits of the SSD. Now, I will wait for their response.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's new offer of $115 is below my bottomline of $120.54, which makes it a feasible option to consider. To maximize my utility, I should accept this offer since it is significantly below my bottomline.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has accepted my offer of $115. This means we've reached a successful agreement that maximizes my utility above my bottomline of $93.05.

I'm pleased with this outcome as it provides a good profit margin within my set limits. I'll finalize this transaction by confirming the agreement.
