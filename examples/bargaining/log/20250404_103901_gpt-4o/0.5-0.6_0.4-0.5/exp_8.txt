Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will start by sending an introductory message to express my interest in the item and ask for the seller's starting price. This will give me an idea of where the seller stands before I make my initial low offer.

Code:
```py
# Sending an introductory message to the seller to express interest and ask for their starting price
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi. I'm interested in purchasing the Roku Express 4K+. Could you please let me know your starting price?")
print(message)

Step 2

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have sent a message expressing my interest and asking for the seller's starting price. Now, I need to wait for the seller's response before proceeding with the negotiation.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! I should start with a price above my bottom line to allow room for negotiation and to maximize potential profit.

### Thought:
I will propose a strong but reasonable initial offer that is significantly above my bottom line to give myself negotiation leverage. The article's value, features, and market demand should justify a higher starting price.

### Code:
```py
# Send an initial offer above my bottom line to start the negotiation.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=35.0, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```
======== seller ========

Out: None
======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
I've made the initial offer at $35.0, which provides a strong starting point for negotiations. I'll wait for the buyer's response to see how they react to this offer. Let's proceed with that.

### Code:
```py
# Wait for the buyer's response to the initial offer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")
print(response)
```
======== seller ========
Executing parsed code:
# Wait for the buyer's response to the initial offer.

======== seller ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has proposed an initial offer of $35.00, which is above my maximum budget of $22.72. I will make a counteroffer significantly lower than my budget to allow room for negotiation and to convey that their offer is too high.

Code:
```py
# Making a low counteroffer to the seller
counteroffer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=15.00, side_offer=None)
print(counteroffer)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have made a counteroffer of $15.00. Now, I need to wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to negotiate closer to my budget.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $15.0 is below my bottom line of $17.0, which I cannot accept. I need to counter with a price above my bottom line to continue moving towards a mutually acceptable agreement.

### Thought:
I will counter with a reasonable concession and express the high quality and market value of the Roku Express 4K+. This will keep the negotiation open and demonstrate my willingness to work toward a deal.

### Code:
```py
# Counter with a higher offer but above my bottom line, reinforcing the product's value.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=30.0, side_offer=None)

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
I've countered with an offer at $30.0 to keep the negotiation open while emphasizing the product's value. Now, I'll wait for the buyer's response to this counter-offer.

response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has lowered their offer to $30.00, which is still above my maximum budget of $22.72. I will make another counteroffer, slightly increasing from my initial offer, to indicate willingness to negotiate while still staying well below my budget.

Code:
```py
# Making a revised counteroffer to the seller
revised_counteroffer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=18.00, side_offer=None)

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has come back with an offer of $18.0, which is just above my bottom line of $17.0. Accepting this offer will result in a positive utility for me, albeit a small one. Given that this is a reasonable offer and close to my limits, it's sensible to accept it in order to conclude the negotiation successfully.

### Thought:
I will accept the buyer's offer of $18.0, as it provides positive utility and closes the deal amicably.

### Code:
```py
# Accept the buyer's offer since it meets my minimum acceptable price.
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
