Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Since I am the buyer, I'll start by sending an initial low offer to give myself room to negotiate. My objective is to negotiate the price well below my bottomline of 157.48. I'll begin the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than my maximum to establish a strong initial position.

Code:
```py
# Start negotiation by making a low initial offer for the item.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=100, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Since I have sent the initial offer, I need to wait for the seller's response to see if they accept, reject, or counter the offer.

Code:

# Wait for the seller's response to the initial offer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's offer of $100 is below my bottomline of $139.58, which would result in negative utility. I need to firmly reject this offer and propose a counteroffer above my bottomline to start the negotiation.

Code: 
```py
# Reject the buyer's offer and propose a counteroffer above my bottomline.
respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
```

======== seller ========
Executing parsed code:
# Reject the buyer's offer and propose a counteroffer above my bottomline.
respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
======== seller ========
Out: A response to the offer has been sent.
======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Now that I have rejected the offer, I should make a counteroffer to the buyer. I will start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while emphasizing the product's quality and benefits.

Code:
```py
# Send a counteroffer to the buyer with a price above my bottomline, emphasizing product quality.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=200, side_offer="This top-tier AI-driven mesh WiFi system offers unparalleled coverage and speed.")

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's counteroffer of 200 is above my bottomline of 157.48, which means I cannot accept it. I need to make a counteroffer that is a reasonable step up from my initial offer, aiming to get as close to or below my bottomline as possible without reaching it.

Code:
```py
# Make a counteroffer to the seller's price, increasing moderately from my initial offer.
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=120, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)

Execution logs:A new offer has been sent.
Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: After making the counteroffer of 120, I should wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to move closer to my price range. This will give me an idea of how flexible they are in negotiating.

Code:
```py
# Wait for the seller's response to the counteroffer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
# Wait for the seller's response to the counteroffer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's new offer of $120 is still below my bottomline of $139.58, which would result in negative utility. I need to reject this offer again and propose a counteroffer closer to the middle ground.

Code:
```py
# Reject the buyer's offer again as it is below my bottomline.
respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
```
======== seller ========
Executing parsed code:
# Reject the buyer's offer again as it is below my bottomline.

======== seller ========
Out: A response to the offer has been sent.
======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have rejected the offer. Now, I will propose a new counteroffer that is still above my bottomline but slightly lower than my previous offer to encourage the buyer to accept. Emphasize the unique benefits of the product to justify the price. 

Code:
```py
# Make a counteroffer at a more competitive price with emphasis on unique features.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=180, side_offer="Includes industry-leading 2-year warranty and 24/7 technical support.")

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's new offer at 180 is still higher than my bottomline of 157.48, but they have added value with a 2-year warranty and 24/7 technical support. I should make another counteroffer that reflects my budget constraint but acknowledges the added value. I'll aim slightly higher than before, but still below my bottomline.

Code:
```py
# Make another counteroffer considering the seller's side offer but stay below my budget limit.
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=140, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)

======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have sent a counteroffer of 140, which is still significantly below the seller's previous offer of 180. Now, I should wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to lower their price further, possibly close to my counteroffer.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's offer of $140 is just slightly above my bottomline of $139.58. Accepting this offer would provide minimal utility, but it's better than no deal at all. It seems the buyer is nearing their limit, so I will accept this offer to secure a sale.
