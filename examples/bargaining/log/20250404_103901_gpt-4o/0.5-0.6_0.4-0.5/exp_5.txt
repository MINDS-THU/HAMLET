Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $15.0 is significantly below my bottomline of $27.73, which would result in negative utility for me. I must reject this offer and propose a counteroffer that aligns more closely with my bottomline and strategic goals. I'll start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation while highlighting the product's quality and benefits to justify my price.

**Thought:** I need to counter with a higher price that allows room for negotiation while emphasizing the quality and features of the Kidde Carbon Monoxide Detector.

# Reject the current offer and make a counteroffer
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
