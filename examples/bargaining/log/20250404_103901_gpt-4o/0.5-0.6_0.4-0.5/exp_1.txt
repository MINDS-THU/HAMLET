Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As the buyer, I will initiate the negotiation by expressing interest in the DEWALT 20V MAX* LED Work Light / Flashlight and ask the seller for their starting price to begin the dialogue.

# Send a message to the seller to initiate the negotiation process
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in the DEWALT 20V MAX* LED Work Light / Flashlight. Could you let me know your starting price?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I should start with a strong, firm price above my bottomline to leave room for negotiation, while also considering the unique features and high demand for the flashlight. I'll propose an initial price above the minimum acceptable to maximize potential profit.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller's initial offer is $75.00, which is significantly above my bottomline of $45.51. I need to counter with a substantially lower offer to push the price closer to my target range and maximize my utility. I will make an initial offer of $30 to open up negotiation space.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's offer of 30.0 is below my bottomline (40.1), and accepting it would result in negative utility. I need to counter with a slightly lower offer than initially stated to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, while still prioritizing utility maximization. 

Code:

# Counter the buyer's offer with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has come down to $70, but this is still above my bottomline of $45.51. I need to make another counteroffer that is more than my previous offer but still well below my limit. I will offer $35 to continue negotiations and encourage the seller to lower the price more.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has lowered their offer to $40.10, which is below my bottomline of $45.51. Accepting this offer would maximize my utility as it's less than my maximum budget. This offer also aligns with my strategic goal of settling well below the bottomline.
