**Thought:**  
To begin the negotiation as the buyer, I need to open with a low initial offer to establish leverage. It's important to signal my constraints and budget limits early on. I will start by expressing interest in the Casio G-Shock watch and ask for the seller's starting price.  

**Code:**
```py
# Initiate negotiation by expressing interest and asking for the seller's starting price.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the Casio G-Shock GWM5610-1 watch. Could you let me know your starting price?")
