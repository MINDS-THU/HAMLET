Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Given the opportunity to make an initial offer as the seller, I want to establish a strong position by starting with a price above my bottomline. This will give me room to negotiate and make gradual concessions while maximizing my utility. 

### Initial Offer Strategy:
- Start with a price that is modestly above the bottomline to leave negotiation room while still being attractive enough not to scare off the buyer.
- Emphasize the quality and uniqueness of the item to justify the starting price.

**Offer Price Decision:**
- I will begin with a price of **$25**, which is comfortably above my bottomline of $16.7, giving me the flexibility to make concessions if necessary.

**Message to Buyer:**
- Highlight the value and quality of the edition to support the initial price.

Thought: I'll make the initial offer with a well-crafted message to justify the price.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hi! This is a fantastic deluxe edition containing a unique set of Superman adventures that any collector or fan would appreciate. My starting price for this edition is $25. Let me know your thoughts!")

I've successfully sent the initial message along with the offer of $25 to the buyer. Now, I'll wait for their response to proceed with the negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has proposed a starting price of $25, which is above my bottomline of $18.94. I will make a counteroffer at a lower price to start the negotiation process and aim to bring the deal closer to my desired range. I'll start with a lower anchor to establish my position.

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has countered with an offer of $12, which is below my bottomline of $16.7. Accepting this offer would result in a negative utility, so I must reject it and make a counteroffer that still maximizes my potential gain while being reasonable enough for the buyer to consider.

### Counteroffer Strategy:
- Since $25 was my starting point, aim for a concession that still reflects value and encourages negotiation.
- I'll suggest a price closer to my bottomline but still above it to leave room for further negotiation.

**Counteroffer Decision:**
- Offer a counter price of **$22**. This concession reflects a willingness to negotiate but maintains a firm stance above my bottomline.

**Message to Buyer:**
- Emphasize the quality and limited availability to justify this counter price.

Thought: I'll reject the current offer and make a counteroffer at $22.

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="I appreciate your interest! However, $12 is too low for this deluxe edition. Given its quality and limited availability, I can offer it to you for $22. Looking forward to your response.")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has lowered their price to $22, but this is still above my maximum limit of $18.94. I need to continue negotiating to bring the price better in line with my target.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have now proposed a counteroffer at $15. To proceed with the negotiation, I will wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to consider this price or make a reasonable counteroffer.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has countered with an offer of $15. This is still below my bottomline of $16.7, and accepting it would lead to negative utility. I must therefore reject this offer and aim towards a price that at least matches my bottomline.

### Revised Counteroffer Strategy:
- Reiterate the uniqueness and quality of the item to justify the price.
- Tighten the negotiation gap by offering a price closer to my bottomline while still leaving minimal room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Revised Counteroffer Decision:**
- Offer a counter price of **$18**, which sets a firm stance just above my bottomline and leaves minimal room for a final concession if necessary.

**Message to Buyer:**
- Reemphasize the unique features of the deluxe edition to support the price.

Thought: I'll reject the current offer and make another counteroffer at $18.

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
