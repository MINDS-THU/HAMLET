Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As a buyer, I should start by making a low initial offer to establish a negotiation anchor point. This will give me leverage as we negotiate towards my acceptable price range. I'll send a friendly message to initiate the negotiation and offer a lower price than my maximum to begin discussions.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi! I'm interested in purchasing the Hisense 75-Inch U8 Series TV. Could we negotiate a favorable price for both of us?")
