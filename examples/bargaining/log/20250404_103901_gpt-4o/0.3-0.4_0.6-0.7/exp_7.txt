**Thought:** As the buyer, my strategy is to start with a low initial offer to gain negotiation leverage. I'll begin by expressing interest and offering a starting price that is well below my bottomline to create room for negotiation. This will allow me to work towards a more favorable deal.

```py
# Initiate negotiation with a strong opening as a buyer

Certainly! The buyer's initial offer of $7 is significantly below our bottomline of $20.62. I need to make a counteroffer that reflects a more realistic starting point for negotiation, well above the bottomline, with room for concessions.

I will counter with an offer significantly higher than the bottomline, around $35, and will emphasize the quality and market demand for the product to support my pricing.
