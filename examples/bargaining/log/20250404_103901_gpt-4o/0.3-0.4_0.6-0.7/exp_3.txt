Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Sure, let's start the negotiation process.

**Thought:** As a buyer, my goal is to secure a price well below my bottomline of 8.81. I'll start by initiating contact and probing for a starting price from the seller. This way, I get an idea of their initial stance before presenting my initial low offer.

**Code:**
```py
# Start the negotiation by asking the seller for their starting price
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in the Amazon Basics Full Synthetic Motor Oil - 5W-30 - 5 Quart. Could you please let me know your starting price?")
print(message)
```

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** I've sent an initial message to the seller to inquire about their starting price. Now, I'll wait for their response to strategize my next move effectively.

**Code:**
```py
# Wait for the seller's response to the initial message
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is interested in the item, giving me a good opportunity to start the negotiation with a price above my bottomline. I will make an initial offer higher than 16.57 to leave room for negotiation. Starting with $25 would be a reasonable price considering market dynamics.

Code:
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=25, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

wait_response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller's initial offer of 25 is considerably above my maximum budget of 8.81. I need to counter with a low initial offer to signal my stance and establish room for negotiation. I'll start with a significantly lower offer to anchor the negotiation favorably for me.

**Code:**
```py
# Make a low counteroffer to anchor the negotiation
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=5, side_offer=None)

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's offer of $5 is significantly lower than my bottomline of $16.57. I will reject this offer and emphasize the high quality and market value of the product. Then, I will make a counteroffer closer to my initial proposal to try and anchor the price higher.

Code:
```py
# Reject the offer and send a message explaining the product's value
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has slightly lowered their price, but 22 is still way above my maximum limit of 8.81. To continue negotiating effectively, I'll have to express my budget constraints and make another counteroffer that increases slightly from my previous proposal, but still well below my limit.

**Thought:** The seller has reduced their price to 20, but it is still significantly above my maximum limit. I'll need to convince the seller by providing stronger reasoning related to my budget and market comparisons.
