I have responded by rejecting the buyer's offer of $52 and made a new counteroffer at $100. I also sent a message highlighting the SSD's popularity and quality to justify this pricing, suggesting it's a fair and competitive offer. I'll wait to see how the buyer responds to this strategic positioning.

**Thought:** The seller has lowered their price to $100, which is still significantly higher than my maximum budget. I need to communicate clearly that I'm very close to my final offer to encourage them to go lower. I'll offer $54, which is the maximum I can pay, and emphasize that this is my final offer.

**Thought:** The buyer’s offer of $54 is still below my bottom line of $94.49. It's important to reiterate the value of the SSD and emphasize that my previous counteroffer was very reasonable.
