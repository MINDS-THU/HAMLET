Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
Before initiating the negotiation, I must establish a strategy considering my role as a buyer. My goal is to get the seller to a price well below my maximum of $187.77. Given this, Iâ€™ll start with a low initial offer to establish room for negotiation. It's prudent to anchor the price low, possibly around $120, to create a clear space for negotiation and get the seller to bring the price down as far as possible.

**Code:**  
```py
# Start the negotiation by sending a polite introductory message
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the DEWALT Miter Saw. Could you please share your offer price?")
print(message)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has requested my offer price for the DEWALT Miter Saw. To maximize my utility, I should start with a firm but reasonable initial price above my minimum acceptable price. This will allow room for negotiation. I will also emphasize the value and demand for the product to justify my initial offer.

**Code:**
```py
# Make an initial offer with a reasonable price above the bottomline

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
The seller's starting price of $600 is significantly higher than my spending limit of $187.77. I need to negotiate this price down substantially. To create an effective counteroffer, I'll propose a considerably lower price, which helps anchor the negotiation to more favorable terms for the buyer. Starting at $120 allows room for negotiation and indicates where we are aiming.
