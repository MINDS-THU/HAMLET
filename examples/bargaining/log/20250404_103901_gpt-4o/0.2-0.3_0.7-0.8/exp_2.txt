Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** To begin the negotiation as a buyer, I should start with a low initial offer to set an anchor, giving room for negotiation, but still aiming to keep the price significantly below my bottomline of 3.98. I will also send a message to express interest in the item, which allows for rapport building and can open the dialogue.

Sure, the buyer's initial offer of $2.5 is far below my bottomline of $13.66, and accepting it would lead to negative utility.
