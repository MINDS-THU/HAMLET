Given the buyer's offer of $50, it's significantly below my bottomline of $238. My strategy is to make a counteroffer closer to a reasonable market value, while leaving room for negotiation. I'll also emphasize the value and quality of the product.

**Thought:** I need to reject the buyer's offer of $50 as it is significantly below my bottomline. I'll make a counter-offer with a reasonable price above my minimum acceptable amount, while highlighting the product's value.
