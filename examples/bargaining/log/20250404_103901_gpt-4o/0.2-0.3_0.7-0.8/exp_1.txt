Here is your code snippet:
The negotiation has officially concluded without reaching an agreement, as the buyer has exited negotiations. Throughout the process, I adhered to my bottomline and attempted to secure the best possible outcome. Unfortunately, the offers did not align with the minimum acceptable price, so walking away was the most strategic decision. If the buyer returns with a more reasonable offer, I will be open to negotiations in the future.
Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
Thoughts: Your thoughts
Code:
```py
# Your python code here
```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.

final_summary = final_answer(answer="The negotiation has concluded without reaching an agreement, as the buyer has exited. The offers presented did not meet the seller's minimum acceptable price, resulting in no deal. The seller is open to future negotiations if a more reasonable offer is proposed.")
