Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thank you for initiating the negotiation process. I'll begin by sending a message to express my interest in the product and ask for the seller’s initial offer, which will help set the stage for our negotiation.

**Thought:** I want to start the negotiation by expressing interest in the item and asking for the seller's initial offer. This will give me a better idea of the starting point for negotiations.

**Code:**
```py
# Sending an initial message to the seller to express interest and request their initial price.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello, I'm interested in purchasing the VIZIO V-Series 5.1 Home Theater Sound Bar. Could you please let me know your starting price?")
print(message)
```

print(message)
======== buyer ========

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
I've sent a message to the seller expressing my interest in the sound bar and asked for their starting price. Now I'll wait for the response to see where the seller stands in terms of pricing.

**Thought:** I need to wait for the seller's response to my initial message before proceeding further.

**Code:**
```py
# Waiting for the seller's response to my initial message.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
# Waiting for the seller's response to my initial message.

======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! We need to start with a strong and assertive opening offer, above our bottomline, to allow room for negotiation. Considering the needs to strategically anchor the negotiation, I will set a starting offer significantly higher than the bottomline to maximize our potential utility while ensuring there's space for concessions.

**Thought:** I want to set an initial offer above our bottomline to leave room for negotiation. I'll make a precise offer to communicate firmness.

**Code:**
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=120, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Output message of the LLM:
I have made an initial offer of $120 for the VIZIO V-Series 5.1 Home Theater Sound Bar. Now, I'll wait for the buyer's response to see their position and continue the negotiation process accordingly.

**Code:**
```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")

Executing parsed code:

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has proposed an offer of $120. This is below my bottomline of $147.68, which means I have room to negotiate further to try and secure a better deal. 

**Thought:** The initial offer from the seller is reasonable, but I should make a lower counteroffer to maximize my utility. I will start with an anchor price significantly lower to provide room for negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
# Making a counteroffer to the seller to secure a better deal.
counteroffer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=95, side_offer=None)
print(counteroffer)

Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
I've sent a counteroffer to the seller with a price of $95. Now I will wait for the seller's response to see if they accept my offer or counter with a different offer.

**Thought:** I need to wait for the seller’s response to my counteroffer before taking any further action.

**Code:**
```py
# Waiting for the seller's response to my counteroffer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
# Waiting for the seller's response to my counteroffer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has proposed an offer of $95. This is above our bottomline of $84.51, which means it is already a profitable offer for us. However, to maximize our utility, it’s important to negotiate further. We should counter with a slightly revised offer to see if we can achieve a higher deal.

**Thought:** Counter the buyer's offer with a price slightly lower than our initial one, indicating we’re willing to negotiate but still aiming to improve our utility.

**Code:**
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=110, side_offer=None)

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
I have countered with an offer of $110, which is closer to the buyer's offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming to maximize utility. Now, I will wait for the buyer's response.

**Code:**
```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has countered with a price of $110, which is lower than their initial offer but higher than my last offer. This is still a good deal compared to my bottomline, but I will make another counteroffer to try and secure an even lower price.

**Thought:** I will make another counteroffer slightly higher than my last one to move toward the seller's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a lower price.

**Code:**
```py
# Making another counteroffer closer to the seller's new offer to try securing a better price.
counteroffer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=100, side_offer=None)
print(counteroffer)
```

Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
I've sent another counteroffer to the seller with a price of $100. I'll now wait to see if the seller is willing to accept this offer or provides another counteroffer.

**Thought:** I need to wait for the seller’s response to see whether they accept my latest offer or make another move.

**Code:**
```py
# Waiting for the seller's response to my latest counteroffer.
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has countered with an offer of $100. This is still above our bottomline of $84.51, and it presents a reasonable opportunity for us. Still, since the offer is above the bottomline and close to the recent counteroffer we sent, accepting it would lead to a satisfactory profit.

**Thought:** Since the buyer's offer of $100 is above our bottomline and close to our previous offer, accepting this ensures a good profit margin and avoids any negotiation stalemate.

**Code:**
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
