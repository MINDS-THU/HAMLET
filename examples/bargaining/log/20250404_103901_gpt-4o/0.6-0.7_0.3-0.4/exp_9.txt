Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, I want to initiate the negotiation with a strong position. I'll start with a lower offer to provide room for the seller to negotiate upwards. I also want to communicate a sense of budget constraint to anchor the negotiation in my favor. 

I'll make an opening offer of $150, significantly below my bottomline of $197.7, and mention my budget constraints.

**Code:**
```py
# Send initial low offer message to start negotiation
offer_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the GIGABYTE M27Q 27\" monitor. My budget is somewhat limited, so I'd like to start with an offer of $150.")

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made an initial offer of $150, which is above my bottomline of $100.02. However, I want to maximize my utility, so I'll propose a counteroffer slightly higher, while considering the fact that they mentioned a limited budget.

**Thought:** I'll counter the buyer's offer with a higher price, emphasizing the monitor's high quality and demand, but still leaving room for further negotiation.

**Code:**
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your offer. The GIGABYTE M27Q is a high-quality monitor with several advanced features, and there has been significant interest from other buyers. Given its demand, I'm willing to offer it for $190 along with fast payment benefits.")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has countered with a price of $190, which is under my bottomline of $197.7, but I can attempt to negotiate slightly lower to increase my utility. I'll aim for $180, while accepting the side offer of fast payment to encourage the seller to accept.

# Counter with $180 and accept fast payment as the side offer
