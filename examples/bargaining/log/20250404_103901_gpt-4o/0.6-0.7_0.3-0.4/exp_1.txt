======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I'll start the negotiation by sending a message to express interest in the product and ask for the seller's starting price. This will help me understand their pricing position and initiate the discussion on a favorable note.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the MICROJIG GRR-RIPPER GR-100 3D Table Saw Pushblock. Could you please let me know your starting price?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** Given the buyer's interest, I'll start with a strong and assertive opening offer above my bottomline of $21.88 to leave room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit. I will use a precise price to signal firmness and reference the product's quality and uniqueness to justify the price.

**Code:**
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=39.99, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for the buyer's response to my offer.

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has offered a price of $39.99. This price is below my bottomline of $42.52, but it would be better for me to negotiate further to enhance my utility. I will make a counteroffer at a lower price to try and get a better deal.

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have made a counteroffer of $32.00 to the seller. Now, I will wait for their response to see if they are willing to negotiate further within this price range.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has proposed $32. This offer is above my bottomline of $21.88, allowing for a positive utility outcome. While it's a step down from my initial offer, it's within a reasonable negotiation range. To maintain momentum and show willingness to compromise, I'll counter slightly higher to negotiate towards a better profit margin.

**Code:**
```py
# Counteroffer slightly higher than the buyer's offer to maximize my utility while keeping the negotiation going.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=36.99, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for the buyer's response to my new offer.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has come down further and is offering the item for $36.99. This offer is still below my bottomline, but I can try to maximize my utility by negotiating a further reduction. I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can lower the price even more.

**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to $34. This offer is not far from my previous counter of $36.99 and remains within a favorable range for negotiation. Accepting this offer will provide a good balance of negotiation success and utility maximization without risking the deal falling through. Hence, I will accept this offer.
