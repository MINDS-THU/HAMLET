======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As the buyer, I should start with a strong and assertive opening. I'll begin by making a low initial offer to establish my negotiation position.

Code:
```py
# Opening with a low initial offer to set the negotiation baseline
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=800, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for the seller's response to my offer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer's offer of $800 is substantially above my bottomline of $592.37, resulting in a seller utility of 800 - 592.37 = 207.63. This is an excellent offer, providing a significant positive utility. Accepting this offer would maximize my utility while ensuring the negotiation is successful.

**Code:**
```py
# Accept the buyer's offer as it provides a high utility that is above my bottomline.
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
print(response)
```
