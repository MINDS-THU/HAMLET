Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has proposed an initial offer of $150 with a side offer of fast payment. At $150, my utility would be $18.52, but I want to aim for a higher utility to maximize profit. It's important to start with a higher price to allow room for negotiation and to emphasize the value of the iPad. I will make a counteroffer slightly above the market value, highlighting the iPad's features and demand.
