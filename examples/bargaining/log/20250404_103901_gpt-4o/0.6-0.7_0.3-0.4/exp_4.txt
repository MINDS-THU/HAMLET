Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! I'll start the negotiation by sending a message to express interest and to ask for the seller's starting price. This will help in understanding their initial position and give us room to negotiate a better deal. 

Thought: Start the negotiation by expressing interest and asking for the seller's starting price to understand their initial offer.

Code:
```py
# Express interest and ask for the seller's starting price
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the Level Lock+ Smart Lock. Could you please let me know your starting price?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I need to establish a strong initial position by setting a higher starting price to leave room for negotiation. I will emphasize the product's advanced features and quality to justify my starting price.

Code:
```py
# Sending an introductory message with a starting price offer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hi! The Level Lock+ Smart Lock is an excellent choice for secure and convenient home access. My starting price for this advanced smart lock is $200. It's a premium product that offers a great balance of functionality and style.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller's starting price is $200, which is below my absolute maximum limit of $206.07. However, my goal is to negotiate an even better deal well below this limit.

Thought: Respond with a lower counteroffer to maximize negotiation space, while keeping the seller engaged in the negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Make a counteroffer to the seller, offering $150
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=150, side_offer=None)

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has offered $150. This is below my starting price but still above my bottomline of $128.45. I should make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my starting price to move the negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price while still maximizing my utility.

Code:
```py
# Making a counteroffer slightly above the buyer's offer but below my initial price
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=180, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has proposed a new offer at $180. This is a reasonable reduction, but there's still room to negotiate for a better price close to $150 to maximize my utility. 

Thought: Propose another counteroffer below $180 to push for a better deal but show slight flexibility from the $150 initial offer.

Code:
```py
# Make another counteroffer at $165 to continue the negotiation
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=165, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $165. This shows a willingness to compromise. I could propose a slightly higher figure to try and move them closer to my preferred price point, or accept their offer if negotiations seem tough. I will attempt another counteroffer slightly above their current offer to maximize utility. 

Code:

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has now proposed a new offer at $175. This price is still well below my absolute maximum limit, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the initial starting points. Accepting this offer will provide a good balance between cost and securing the deal.

Thought: Accept the seller's offer of $175 as it is within an acceptable range and provides good utility.
