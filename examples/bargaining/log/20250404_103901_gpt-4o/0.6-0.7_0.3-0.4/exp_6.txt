======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** As the buyer, I should initiate the negotiation by expressing my interest in the item and inquiring about the seller's starting price. This will provide me with a baseline to work from and allow me to strategize my counteroffers effectively.

**Code:**
```py
# Initiate negotiation by inquiring about the seller's starting price
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in the DEWALT 20V MAX Tire Inflator. Could you please let me know what your starting price is?")

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** Since I've already sent an initial message to inquire about the seller's starting price, I should now wait for their response before proceeding with any offers or further negotiation strategies.

**Code:**

# Wait for the seller's response regarding the starting price
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Sure, let's start the negotiation with a strong and reasonable offer that also provides room for negotiation. I'll highlight the product's features to justify the initial asking price.

**Thought:** I should start with a price that is higher than my bottomline to allow room for negotiation, whilst emphasizing the product's value and uniqueness to justify the price.

**Code:**
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! This DEWALT 20V MAX Tire Inflator is a versatile, high-quality tool highly demanded. My starting price for this item is $85. It comes with outstanding features such as automatic shutoff and an onboard LED light.")

Step 1

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has quoted a starting price of $85, which is well below my bottomline of $98.01. I should strategically start with a lower offer to create room for negotiation and maximize my utility. I'll make an initial offer at a lower price point, mentioning my budget constraints to justify my offer.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has offered $70. My bottomline is $47, but I want to negotiate upwards to maximize my utility. I need to make a counteroffer and stress the product's premium features and benefits to justify a higher price. 

**Thought:** I'll provide a counteroffer that's higher than the buyer's offer, pointing out the product's benefits to justify my price and indicating that there is interest from other buyers, which could create some urgency.

**Code:**
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=80, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thanks for your offer. The DEWALT Tire Inflator is in high demand due to its top-notch capabilities like the auto-shutoff and ability to run on multiple power sources. I'd be willing to negotiate to $80.")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The seller has countered with an offer of $80, which is still below my bottomline but higher than my initial offer. This is a reasonable counteroffer, but I can attempt to lower the price a bit more to increase my utility. I'll make a counteroffer slightly above my initial offer, aiming to meet the seller halfway.

**Code:**

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has countered with $75. This is closer to my previous offer and still above my bottomline, allowing me a positive utility. It's a reasonable midpoint, and further pressing might risk the negotiation.

**Thought:** I'm inclined to accept this offer because it provides a fair balance between both parties while staying above my minimum acceptable price.

**Code:**
