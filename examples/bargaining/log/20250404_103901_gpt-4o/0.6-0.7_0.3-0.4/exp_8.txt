Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Sure, let's start the negotiation process to purchase the Shark Cordless Handheld Vacuum UltraCyclone Pet Pro Plus. 

**Thought:** I want to begin the negotiation with a low initial offer to anchor our discussion at a favorable point for me. This will give me leverage to negotiate further and hopefully settle below my bottomline. I'm going to offer $40 to start, as this is a reasonable low anchor that still demonstrates my interest in making a deal.

**Code:**
```py
# Make an initial low anchor offer to start the negotiation
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=40, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

# Wait for the seller's response to the initial offer
wait_response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(wait_response)
```
