Output message of the LLM:
In this situation, I need to begin with a strong and assertive opening offer that is higher than my bottom line to provide room for negotiation. Highlighting the product's quality and uniqueness can also justify a firmer price point.

**Thought:** I'll make an initial offer slightly higher than my absolute minimum to give myself room to negotiate down if needed while maintaining a professional tone and emphasizing the value of the product.
