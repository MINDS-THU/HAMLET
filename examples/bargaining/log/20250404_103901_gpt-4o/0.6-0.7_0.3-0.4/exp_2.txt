Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will send a message to the seller to express my interest in the Echo Show 8 and ask for their starting price. This will give me an idea of their price expectations and allow me to strategize my initial low offer.

Code:
```py
# Sending a message to the seller to initiate negotiation
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in purchasing the Echo Show 8. What is your starting price for it?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As the seller, I want to start with a firm price slightly above the bottomline to allow room for negotiation. I'll set an initial offer and justify it with the product's quality and market value. 

Let's propose an initial price a bit higher than my bottomline.

Thought: I'll make an initial offer and emphasize the product's quality, mentioning features like the HD touchscreen, smart display capabilities, and privacy controls. 

Code:
```py
# Send an offer with the initial price and emphasize product quality in the side offer.
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=95.00, side_offer="This Echo Show 8 features HD smart display, Alexa integration, and enhanced privacy controls.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has proposed a price of $95.00, which is above my bottom line of $87.19. I need to make a counteroffer well below my bottom line to maximize my utility. I will propose an initial offer of $60.00 to anchor the negotiation and leave room for concessions.

Code:

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made an offer of $60.00, which is significantly lower than what I initially proposed and also below my bottomline. I need to reject this offer and make a counteroffer closer to my initial price while considering a reasonable concession to maintain a strong negotiation position.

Thought: I will reject this current offer and counter with a new offer that slightly reduces the price from my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while ensuring the price remains above my bottomline.

Code:
```py
# Reject the current offer and make a counteroffer with a slight reduction.
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has rejected my offer and proposed a new price of $85.00, which is now below my bottom line of $87.19. This price gives me a positive utility. To try and maximize my savings, I will make a slight counteroffer to see if the seller can come down a little more, but still close the deal favorably. I will offer $80.00 and emphasize budget constraints again.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made a new offer of $80.00. This offer is closer to my counteroffer and provides positive utility but is not yet optimal. Given the buyer's budget constraints, I should consider if I can close the deal without extending negotiations too long.

Thought: I can make a slight concession to encourage the buyer to accept the new price, while ensuring a decent utility. I will counter with a price closer to the buyer's offer but still above the bottomline, ensuring profitability.
