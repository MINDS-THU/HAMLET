======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To start the negotiation, I should express my interest in the Apple Watch and inquire about the seller's openness to negotiate. This sets a friendly tone and opens the door for further discussion. I'll also prepare to make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to create space for negotiation.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the Apple Watch Series 9 you have listed. Are you open to negotiating the price?")
print(message)
```

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The interest shown by the buyer presents a good opportunity to anchor our initial offer. I'll respond to the buyer, reiterating the value of the product, and propose our initial offer. I will start slightly below the listing price to allow room for negotiation.

Here's the plan:
1. Send a message to the buyer emphasizing the value and popularity of the Apple Watch Series 9.
2. Make an initial offer slightly below the listing price.

Let's execute that plan.
