======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! I will start the negotiation by sending a message to the seller indicating my interest in the SSD and also making an initial offer. I will offer a price that is significantly below the listing price to leave room for negotiation.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller and make an initial offer of $45, which is well below the listing price but above the starting point to open negotiations.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in purchasing the Crucial P5 Plus SSD. Are you open to negotiation?")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=45, side_offer=None)

Step 1

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer's offer of $45 is below my bottomline price of $50.79, so I cannot accept this offer. I should respond with a counteroffer and an explanation of the value of the SSD to justify my price. I'll start by reiterating the premium features of the Crucial P5 Plus SSD and make an initial counteroffer slightly above my bottomline price to leave room for negotiation. 

**Code:**
```py
# Craft a response message explaining the value of the item and make a counteroffer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="The Crucial P5 Plus SSD is a high-performance drive with remarkable speed and data protection features, ideal for gaming and creative contents. Given its specifications, the starting offer doesn't reflect its value.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has provided a counteroffer of $70 with the inclusion of fast shipping. While this is above my bottom line of $57.14, it's close to it. To maintain the negotiation and try to secure a better deal, I will make a counteroffer slightly higher than my initial offer but below my bottom line, at $52. I'll emphasize my budget constraints to persuade them to lower the price further.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I appreciate your offer. My budget is quite tight, but I'm still very interested in the SSD. Would you consider $52?")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer's new offer of $52 is slightly above my bottomline price of $50.79, which is within my acceptable range. To maximize my utility while still closing the deal, I'll accept this offer. It's important to conclude negotiations favorably while maintaining a good relationship with the buyer.
