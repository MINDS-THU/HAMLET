Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To start the negotiation, I will send a message to the seller to express my interest and see if they are open to negotiating the price. Then, I'll make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to initiate the negotiation process while keeping room for further adjustments. 

Let's begin by sending the initial message.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is interested in the product and is looking to negotiate. I should acknowledge their interest and indicate that I am open to discussing the price while subtly emphasizing the value and features of the product.

Code:
```py

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have acknowledged the buyer's interest and expressed openness to negotiation. Now, I need to wait for the buyer's response to my message and see what offer or counteroffer they propose.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has expressed openness to negotiation and has invited me to make an initial offer. I will make an offer slightly below the listing price to anchor the negotiation while leaving room for further adjustments.

Code:
```py
offer_price = 280.00  # A reasonable starting offer below the listing price of 299.00
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=offer_price, side_offer=None)

Execution logs:A new offer has been sent.
Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has made an initial offer of $280. This is lower than my listing price of $299 but still significantly above the bottomline price of $184.26. I should make a counteroffer closer to the listing price to maximize my utility while showing willingness to negotiate.

Code:
```py

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with a price of $290 and included free shipping as an additional incentive. This is a reasonable offer considering the starting price was $299. However, I have a bit of room to further negotiate the price closer to my bottomline of $298.93. I will make a counteroffer at $285 to see if they are willing to meet me halfway.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 285.00

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have made a counteroffer of $285. Now, I will wait for the seller's response to see if they are willing to agree to this price or provide another counteroffer. This will help me determine the next step in our negotiation.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $285, which is a good sign of their willingness to negotiate. Since $285 is very close to my counteroffer of $290, I should consider accepting it to finalize the deal, as it is still well above my bottomline price.

Code:
```py
# Accept the buyer's offer of $285
offer_response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)

Step 3
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
