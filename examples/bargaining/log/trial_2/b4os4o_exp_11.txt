Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start by sending a message to express my interest in the item and inquire if the seller is open to negotiation. This will pave the way for price discussions.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is expressing interest in the item and is looking to negotiate the price. It's important to maintain a firm position while also being open to negotiation. I will respond positively to the inquiry to keep the conversation positive and initiate the negotiation with a reasonable offer slightly below the listing price to show willingness to negotiate.

Code:

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller is open to negotiation and has made an initial offer of $189.99. I will counter with a reasonable offer below my bottomline price to create room for further negotiation. I will offer $100.00 initially, which gives significant room for adjustments.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's offer of $100 is significantly below my bottomline price of $74.83 and even further below my initial offer of $189.99. I will need to politely reject this offer but remain open to negotiation by making a concession with a slightly reduced counteroffer to encourage further discussion.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has further increased their offer to $115. This shows gradually growing interest, but the offer still does not align well with my target price.
