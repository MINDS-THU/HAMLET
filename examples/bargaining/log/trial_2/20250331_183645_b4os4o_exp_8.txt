Certainly! I'll start the negotiation by expressing my interest and making an initial offer to open the discussion. I'll offer a price that is below the listing but reasonable enough to engage the seller.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller expressing interest in the item and make an initial offer of $15 to open the negotiation. This offer is lower than my bottomline price, allowing room for negotiation.
