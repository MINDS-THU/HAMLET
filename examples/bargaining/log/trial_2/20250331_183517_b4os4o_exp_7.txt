The buyer has made an initial offer of $200, which is significantly below my bottomline price of $405.97. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a negative utility. My strategy will be to reject this offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my listing price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.

I'll also send a message explaining the value of the TV to justify my higher counteroffer and to encourage a reasonable negotiation. This will help the buyer understand why the price I'm proposing is fair based on the product's features and market value.

First, I'll reject the current offer, then make a counteroffer, and provide additional context through a message.
