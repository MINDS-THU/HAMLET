Output message of the LLM:
Starting a negotiation with the buyer, it's essential to emphasize the value of the product. I'll provide a strong initial position by highlighting the features and benefits of the Nespresso VertuoPlus to justify the listing price while also indicating that there might be room for negotiation to keep the discussion open. This way, we maintain control and set the reference point.

Let's begin by crafting a response.

Thought: I will respond to the buyer, emphasizing the quality and value of the Nespresso VertuoPlus Coffee and Espresso Machine and indicating that while the listing price reflects this value, I am open to considering reasonable offers. This will set a positive tone for the negotiation while establishing the product's worth.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! The Nespresso VertuoPlus is an exceptional coffee and espresso machine with advanced features, ensuring a superb brewing experience. The listing price accurately reflects its quality and capabilities. However, I am open to considering reasonable offers. What price do you have in mind?")

The buyer has proposed a price of $100, which is below my bottomline price of $111.74. It's important to maintain the negotiation by emphasizing that this offer is too low, while actively engaging with a counteroffer.

Thought: I will reject the buyer's offer since it is below my bottomline price, and present a counteroffer that is closer to our listing price to reinforce the value of the product. I'll aim to start with a counteroffer slightly below the listing price but well within my acceptable range.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's new offer of $115 is above my bottomline price of $111.74, yet still significantly lower than my counteroffer of $200. This new offer provides a middle ground for further negotiation.

Thought: Since the buyer's offer of $115 is above my bottomline price, I can negotiate by making a counteroffer that is closer to this new offer, while still aiming to maximize my utility.

The buyer has increased their offer to $123. This offer is higher than their previous and shows a willingness to negotiate; however, it is still lower than my midway counteroffer of $157.50.

Thought: Given the buyer's budget constraint and willingness to walk away, if I accept the $123 offer, I will secure a utility of $11.26.
