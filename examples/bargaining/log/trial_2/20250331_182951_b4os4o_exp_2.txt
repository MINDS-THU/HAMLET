Output message of the LLM:
To initiate the negotiation, I will start by expressing interest in the item and inquire if the seller is open to negotiation. This will help set the tone for the discussion and give me insight into the seller's flexibility.

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Sure! Let's start by positioning ourselves favorably in this negotiation to maximize our utility.  

Thought: I'll respond to the buyer's inquiry by confirming that I'm open to negotiation. I will start by making an initial counter-offer slightly below the listing price to demonstrate some flexibility, while leaving room for further negotiation. This approach often helps to anchor the buyer's expectations closer to my listing price.

Code:
```py
# Sending a message to confirm openness to negotiation
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Yes, I'm open to negotiating on the price. The bike is listed at $399, but I can offer it to you at $385 to start our discussion.")

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
My message has been sent to the buyer, confirming that I'm open to negotiation and suggesting a starting price of $385. This should provide an initial anchor while showing some willingness to negotiate.

Thought: Now, I will wait for the buyer's response to see how they react to my initial counter-offer. This will give us more information to adjust our strategy accordingly.

Code:
```py
# Waiting for the buyer's response to my initial offer
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has offered a starting price of $385, which is still significantly above my bottomline price of $198.66. To maximize my utility, I will make a counteroffer considerably lower, to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 

I'll start by offering $150 with the potential for incremental increases if necessary, to leave room for negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's offer of $150 is significantly below my bottomline price of $257.35. It's not acceptable, but it's an opportunity to engage in negotiation and guide the buyer towards a more reasonable price.

Thought: I need to politely reject this offer and make a counter-offer that is closer to our desired price while outlining the value and features of the bike to justify it. I will also consider making a moderate concession from my previous offer to show goodwill in the negotiation.

Code:
```py
