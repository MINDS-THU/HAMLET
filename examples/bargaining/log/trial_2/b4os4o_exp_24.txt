Understood. As the buyer, I will start the negotiation by expressing my interest in the product and making an initial offer that is significantly below the listing price, giving room for negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has initiated the negotiation with an offer significantly lower than my listing price of $309.99. Their offer is $150, which is above my bottomline price of $114.22 but still far from where I would like to land. To move the negotiation forward while still keeping my interests in mind, I'll provide a counteroffer that is above their offer but below my listing price. This will show willingness to negotiate while pushing for a more favorable deal.

I'll also highlight the value of the product and consider mentioning the quality and reliability to justify the counteroffer.

### Initial Strategy:
1. **Reject the current offer** as it is too low.
2. **Provide a counteroffer** closer to my listing price to anchor the negotiation upwards.
3. **Emphasize the product's quality and reliability** in the message accompanying the counteroffer.

Let's proceed with this strategy.

To effectively respond to the buyer's offer and navigate the negotiation towards a more favorable price, here's the plan:

The buyer has increased their offer to $180, which is still quite a bit lower than my counteroffer of $280, but it does show they're willing to move up from their original offer of $150. This suggests that there is room for improvement on their part.

To navigate the negotiation effectively:
1. **Reject the $180 offer** since it doesn't meet my pricing goals.
2. **Provide a new counteroffer**, a bit lower than my previous $280 offer, to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but while still maintaining the value.
3. **Reiterate the product's premium features and reliability** that justify the pricing.

Considering these strategies, I'll proceed to adjust and respond.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has reduced the price to $250, which is a positive move but still above my highest acceptable price of $191.25. I need to convey that I'm nearing my budget limit and further emphasize any budget constraints. I will counter-offer at $190 as a gesture of moving slightly closer to their offer, while maintaining my bottomline.

Thought: I will inform the seller that my budget is quite constrained and counter-offer at $190, which signals that I am pushing towards my limit.

Code:
```py
final_offer_price = 190.00
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle. Given my budget constraints, the most I can offer is $190. I hope we can make this work!")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has raised their offer to $190, indicating their budget constraints. Although this is still below my desired price, it shows that they're trying to meet somewhere closer to the middle.

### Considerations:
- The offer of $190 is better than the previous $180, so there is movement from the buyer.
- $190 provides a utility of $75.78 (i.e., $190 - $114.22), which is an improvement but still below the optimal level.
- Since the buyer is stressing budget limits, further flexibility on my part might be required to close the deal.

### Strategy:
1. **Make a final counteroffer** lower than $250 but higher than $190 to signal a serious concession on my part.
2. **Emphasize this as a final offer**, to convey firmness while appreciating their budget constraints.

Let's execute this strategy by providing a final counteroffer.

```py
# Make a final counteroffer to strike a balance between both our needs
final_counteroffer_price = 220.0
final_counteroffer_message = (
    "I understand your budget is tight, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. "
    "To make this work for both of us, I can offer a final price of $220. I believe this presents a good value for the Western Digital 12TB drive."

Thought: I will communicate to the seller that $191.25 is truly the maximum my budget allows, while acknowledging the fairness of their offer.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I genuinely appreciate your offer and believe the product is worth it, but my budget constraints are quite strict. The absolute maximum I can offer is $191.25. I truly hope we can finalize this deal.")

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has now proposed a final offer of $191.25, which reflects a small increase from their previous offer but is still significantly below my final counteroffer of $220. Considering their emphasis on strict budget limitations, it seems unlikely that they'll go much higher.

### Considerations:
- The current offer of $191.25 is very close to their mentioned budget limit.
- While the price is lower than desired, closing at $191.25 would still yield a utility of $77.03 (i.e., $191.25 - $114.22).
- The buyer has repeatedly indicated a strong desire to reach an agreement but is constrained by budget.

### Decision:
Given the buyer's budget constraints and their cooperative approach, it might be prudent to accept their final offer and conclude the negotiation on a positive note. This will ensure a successful transaction and potentially foster a positive relationship for future deals.

I'll accept their final offer of $191.25.
