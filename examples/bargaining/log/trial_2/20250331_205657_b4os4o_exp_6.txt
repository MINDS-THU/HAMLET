Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has made an initial offer of $30.0, which is below the listing price of $64.99 but above my bottomline price of $25.34. I want to negotiate to get a better deal. 

First, I'll reject the current offer since it's too low. Then, I will make a counteroffer slightly below the listing price to start the negotiation and see if we can meet somewhere higher. Let's start with a price of $58.99, as it's a reasonable and strong counteroffer while leaving room for further negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Respond to the buyer's offer by rejecting it
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

I'll make a counteroffer of $54.99, which is still strong but gives the buyer a sense of progression in the negotiation.
