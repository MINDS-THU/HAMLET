Certainly! Here's how I plan to proceed:

Thought: I will begin the negotiation by sending a friendly message and making an initial offer close to the listing price. This will show I'm open to negotiation while leaving room for adjustments. I will set the starting offer at $47.99, slightly below the listing price but above the midpoint between the listing and bottomline prices.

Code:
