Let's initiate the negotiation by sending a message to express my interest in the Ring Video Doorbell and then making an initial offer below the listing price to start the negotiation process.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller indicating interest in the doorbell and offer a price of $80, which is below the listing price but allows room for negotiation. I will also express potential urgency to encourage engagement.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm very interested in purchasing the Ring Video Doorbell. I'm prepared to make an offer.")

Output message of the LLM:
### Thought:

The buyer is showing interest and has made an initial offer of $80, which is considerably below the listing price of $99.99. However, it is above my bottomline price of $41.6, which is encouraging. Since the offer is also tied with a promise of a quick decision, I have some leverage to negotiate closer to my desired price. I should counter with a higher offer and possibly include a side incentive, like free shipping, to make my offer attractive without cutting too deep into the price.

### Code:
```py
# Propose a counteroffer closer to the listing price with an added incentive of free shipping.
counter_offer_price = 95
side_offer = "Free shipping"

offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=counter_offer_price, side_offer=side_offer)

### Thought:

The buyer has increased their offer slightly to $82 while expressing appreciation for the free shipping and mentioning their budget constraints. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also suggests they might be close to their own limit. To move forward, I should make another counteroffer with a price slightly above this new offer to encourage further negotiation while emphasizing the value offered. I should be careful to not go too far above their current offer to keep the negotiation friendly.

The seller has come down to a price of $90 while still offering free shipping. This price is still above my bottomline of $84.8, so I need to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer, this time closer to my bottomline price, and reiterate my budget constraints.

Thought: I will make a counteroffer of $84, stressing that it is very close to my budget limit, while continuing to appreciate the free shipping offer.
