Output message of the LLM:
Sure! Here's how I plan to proceed:

Thought: The buyer has made an initial offer of $80, which is significantly below my bottomline price of $108.79. This offer is not acceptable. I should quickly reject this offer to signal that such a low price is not under consideration. Then, I will make a counteroffer closer to the listing price to open further negotiation. I'll also highlight the quality and features of the Google Pixel Buds Pro to justify the price. 

Code:
```py
# Reject the buyer's initial offer of $80
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

# Make a counteroffer
counter_offer_price = 190  # A reasonable counteroffer close to the initial listing price

Thought: I have now sent a rejection for the low offer of $80 and made a counteroffer of $190. I will wait for the buyer to respond to my counteroffer, as this will help me gauge their interest and willingness to negotiate closer to my asking price.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has rejected my initial offer and countered with a price of $190. This is still significantly above my bottomline price of $96.5. I will use the strategy of tapering concessions by proposing a slightly higher offer than before, but still well below the seller's counteroffer, to show willingness to negotiate while keeping my target price in mind. I'll also mention my budget constraint to justify my offer.

I will then make a reduced counteroffer closer to the listing price but lower than my previous counteroffer, such as $180, to keep the negotiation moving forward.
