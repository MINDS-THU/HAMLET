Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As the buyer, I will start by showing interest and making an initial offer below the seller's listing price to open the negotiation while leaving room for further adjustments. My approach will be professional and friendly to set a positive tone for the negotiation.

Let's begin by expressing interest and making an initial offer.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller expressing my interest in the item and follow up with an initial offer that is significantly below the listing price, but still reasonable, to leave room for negotiation. The aim is to start the negotiation at a price of 80, which leaves room for concessions.

Code:
```py
# Send a message expressing interest in the item
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in the Ninja Foodi Dual Heat Air Fry Oven. Are you open to negotiating the price?")
print(message)

# Make an initial offer

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=offer_price, side_offer=None)
