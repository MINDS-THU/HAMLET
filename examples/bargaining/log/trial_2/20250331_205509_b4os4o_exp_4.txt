Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer has expressed interest and wants to negotiate the price. This is a standard starting point, so I will respond positively while maintaining the initial price stance. By doing this, I can gauge the buyer's willingness to negotiate and determine how much they may be willing to pay. 

I'll also subtly suggest the product's value which could justify the asking price. This sets the stage for negotiation without lowering the price immediately.

Let's proceed with sending a welcoming message acknowledging their interest and affirming flexibility within reasonable bounds.

```python
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for your interest in the Summer Infant Extra Tall & Wide Safety Pet and Baby Gate. We are open to negotiation within reasonable limits. This is a high-quality safety gate that complements home decor and offers versatile installation. Let's discuss your thoughts.")

I'll make an initial offer that's below my maximum limit to anchor the negotiations in my favor while leaving room for adjustments. I'll also hint at a budget constraint to justify my offer.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made an offer of $40.00, accompanied by a side offer of fast payment while stating a strict budget constraint. This offer is significantly lower than our listing price of $89.99 but still above our bottomline price of $31.91.

Since their offer is close to our bottomline, it's crucial to negotiate carefully. I will make a counteroffer closer to our listing price to see if the buyer is willing to move closer to a higher price. I will mention the product's features and justify the value, aiming to secure a better deal.

Let's proceed by making a counteroffer at a higher price while emphasizing product quality and availability.

```python
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=75.00, side_offer="As it's a high-demand item, it's hard to go much lower, but I can offer free shipping along with this price.")

The buyer has increased their offer slightly to $45.00, appreciating the free shipping, but still cites budget constraints. While it's an improvement from their initial offer, it is still considerably lower than my counteroffer of $75.00.

At this point, I will emphasize the benefits of the product and maintain the value proposition. I'll make another counteroffer, slightly lowering the price to ensure we're making progress in the negotiation.

Let's make a counteroffer at $68.00, stressing the quality and versatility of the product while maintaining the free shipping incentive.

```python

The buyer has further increased their offer to $48.69, stating it as their absolute maximum budget. This is still significantly below my previous counteroffer but demonstrates their willingness to stretch their budget. However, it remains closer to my bottomline price than my ideal selling point.

Given this situation, I'll weigh the likelihood of maximizing the deal within reasonable means against the risk of reaching an impasse. As it stands, the buyer seems to have reached their limit, so a more modest concession might secure the sale while still maintaining satisfactory utility.

I'll make a final counteroffer at a slightly reduced price compared to the previous, to $62.00 while emphasizing this as a final offer with continued free shipping. This provides an opportunity for the buyer to meet us closer to a more reasonable middle ground.
