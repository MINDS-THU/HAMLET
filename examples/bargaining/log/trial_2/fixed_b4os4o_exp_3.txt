Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will begin by sending a message to the seller expressing interest in the board game expansion and inquiring if they are open to negotiations. This will set the tone for potential adjustments in the listing price.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I am interested in the Carcassonne Inns & Cathedrals Board Game Expansion. Would you be open to negotiating the price?")

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
### Thought:

The buyer has expressed interest in the board game expansion and is open to negotiation. It's essential to start the negotiation by establishing that there is some flexibility while still asserting the value of the product. My approach will be to send a friendly message that confirms my openness to negotiation while subtly emphasizing the quality and scarcity of the item. This could create psychological urgency and increase the buyer's willingness to pay. Then, I will make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to give us room for negotiation.

### Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! I'm glad you're interested in the Carcassonne Inns & Cathedrals Board Game Expansion. It's a fantastic addition to the game and quite popular. I'm definitely open to negotiation, so let's find a fair price for both of us.")

### Thought:

I have sent a friendly message to the buyer, indicating my openness to negotiation while emphasizing the product's value. Additionally, I made an initial offer of $18.99, which is slightly below the listing price. Now, I will wait for the buyer's response to my offer.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has indicated their willingness to negotiate, which is positive. However, their initial price of $18.99 is significantly above my maximum willingness to pay ($5.5). To start the negotiation process, I'll make a counteroffer lower than my maximum to allow room for further negotiation. This will also signal to the seller the seriousness of my budget constraint.

Code:

counter_offer_price = 3.5
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=counter_offer_price, side_offer=None)

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
### Thought:

The buyer's offer of $3.50 is significantly below my bottomline price of $14.13, which is unacceptable. I need to quickly reject this offer and emphasize the item's value once again. Then, it would be strategic to make a counteroffer closer to my original offer but slightly lower to show some willingness to compromise while staying within a profitable range.

Output message of the LLM:
### Thought:

The buyer increased their offer to $4.50, which is still significantly below even my bottomline price of $14.13. This indicates that they are either not serious or are significantly underestimating the value of the expansion. I need to clearly communicate that my offers are fair given the product's value and reiterate my willingness to negotiate within an acceptable range. I'll make another counteroffer that slightly lowers my previous one, showing flexibility, but still staying well above my bottomline price.

### Code:
```py
# Respond to the current offer by rejecting it
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

# Send a message justifying the value and reinforcing the negotiation stance

Now, I will wait for their response to see if they make a more realistic counteroffer that aligns with my negotiation limits.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The market prices for the Carcassonne Inns & Cathedrals Expansion vary, with some listings around $19.99 and others going as low as $12.79.

Output message of the LLM:
### Thought:

The buyer has indicated finding the expansion online for $12.79, which suggests they're price-sensitive but also perhaps negotiating. The buyer's new offer of $5.00 is still unacceptably low. However, their mention of $12.79 gives me a potential anchor point for further negotiation. I should address the reference price and reiterate the value and demand for my product while signaling more flexibility to find common ground close to my bottomline price.
