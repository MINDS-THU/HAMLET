Output message of the LLM:
To initiate the negotiation, I will start by sending a message expressing interest in the item and making an initial offer below my bottomline price. This will give us some room to maneuver and see how the seller responds. 

Let's set the initial offer at $20 to start the discussion. 

```py
# Send a message to the seller and make an initial offer
initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in purchasing 'Prey [4K UHD]'. Would you be open to negotiating on the price?")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has offered $20, which is only slightly above our bottom line price of $19.34. This is too low for my initial acceptance as it leaves very little margin above the bottom line. I should counter with a higher price closer to my listing price of $39.99, while leaving room for negotiation. Offering at around $35 may be a reasonable counteroffer to move the negotiation forward while signaling flexibility but maintains plenty of room above my bottom line for further concessions if needed.

```py
