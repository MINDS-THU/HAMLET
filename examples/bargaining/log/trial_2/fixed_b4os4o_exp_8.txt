Sure! I'll start by expressing my interest in the product and make an initial offer well below my bottomline price to provide room for negotiation. 

Let's begin the negotiation process.

Certainly! The buyer has shown interest in the Espresso Machine but has made a very low initial offer of $100, which is far below the listing price of $574.99 and even below my bottomline price of $398.11. My goal is to maximize the selling price while adhering to my constraints.

### Strategy:
1. **Rejection of the Current Offer:** Firmly but politely reject the offer as it's significantly lower than my bottomline.
2. **Provide a Counteroffer:** I will counter with a reasonable price closer to my listing price, indicating the quality and value of the espresso machine.
3. **Emphasize Value:** Highlight the benefits and premium features of the machine to justify the price.
4. **Keep Communication Open:** Encourage the buyer to continue the negotiation with a fair offer.
