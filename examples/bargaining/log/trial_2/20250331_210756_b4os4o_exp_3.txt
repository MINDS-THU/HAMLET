Output message of the LLM:
Thought: As the buyer, I'll start the negotiation by expressing interest in the item and make a reasonable initial offer slightly below the bottomline price. This will leave room for negotiation while signaling that I'm ready to discuss seriously. I'll also mention my budget limitations to anchor the discussion.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello, I'm interested in purchasing the Lifeline 4002 Aluminum Sport Utility Shovel. I have a budget constraint, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.")

Output message of the LLM:
Let's evaluate the buyer's initial offer of $20.50. My starting price is $40.58, and the bottomline price is $13.77. The buyer's offer is below the listing price but above the bottomline price, which indicates some room for negotiation. However, to maximize my utility, I should aim for a higher price than what has been offered.

I will counter the buyer's offer with a slightly reduced price in comparison to the listing price, possibly around $36, to give an impression of moving towards a compromise while leaving ample room for adjustments in further negotiations. Additionally, I'll send a message to emphasize the shovel's value and quality.

Thought: I'll counter with a price of $36 and emphasize the shovel's durability and construction to justify the value.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the Lifeline 4002 Aluminum Sport Utility Shovel. This shovel is made from durable lightweight aluminum, making it a reliable companion for various outdoor activities. Considering the quality and utility of this shovel, I'm willing to offer it at $36. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.")

Thought: The seller has responded by emphasizing the shovel's quality and utility, and they've countered with an offer of $36, which is above my bottomline price of $30.36.

Code:

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has increased their offer to $25.00, which is still below my counteroffer of $36, but it reflects a willingness to negotiate and is above the bottomline price of $13.77. Given these circumstances, I would like to maximize the selling price further, but also be mindful of the buyer's stated budget constraint and their offer of quick payment.

A good approach would be to propose an intermediate price that moves closer to their offer, perhaps around $31, emphasizing once again the quality of the shovel and the fair nature of this new price offer. 

Thought: I will counter with a price of $31 while acknowledging the buyer's budget concerns and emphasizing the quality and value of the shovel.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="I understand your budget constraint, and I genuinely appreciate your willingness to proceed with a quick payment. Given the quality of the shovel and its extended utility, I can offer it to you at $31. I believe this price provides great value for both of us.")
