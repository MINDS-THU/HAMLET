Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will send a message expressing interest in the item and inquire if the seller is open to negotiation. This will set a positive tone and open the floor for price discussions.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! Starting with a positive note helps in establishing rapport. I'll acknowledge the buyer's interest and express willingness to negotiate, while also subtly reinforcing the product's value. I'll then follow with an offer slightly below the listing price to encourage further negotiation.

Thought: I'll respond to the buyer's interest positively. I'll mention the quality and desirability of the product, and make an initial offer that's somewhat lower than the listing price, but higher than halfway to my bottom line, which leaves room for negotiation. This balanced approach sets expectations of a fair negotiation basis. 

Code:
```py
# Sending a welcoming message to the buyer and making an initial offer.
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for your interest in the CLINIQUE Happy For Women Eau De Parfum. It’s a popular choice for its long-lasting and pleasing fragrance. I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with an offer of $42. How does that sound?")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has offered a price of $42, which is still above my bottomline price of $28.41. To continue the negotiation, I will make a counteroffer that is below the seller's current offer, but above my bottomline price to keep the conversation moving. I'll aim for $30, which gives us room for further negotiation while staying reasonable.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has countered with an offer of $30, which is significantly below my initial offer. I need to maintain the negotiation momentum while moving closer to my bottom line cautiously. 

Thought: I will send a message acknowledging the buyer's offer and express appreciation for their interest. I will counter with a new offer closer to their price but still within a reasonable range to represent the product's value without approaching my bottom line. I'll offer $38 this time, indicating my willingness to negotiate while ensuring value.
