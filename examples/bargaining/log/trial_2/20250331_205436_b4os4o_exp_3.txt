Output message of the LLM:
Since I'm initiating the negotiation as the buyer, my strategy will be to make a strong initial offer significantly below the listing price, leaving room for adjustment. I'll also express interest in negotiating to show readiness to discuss. I'll make an offer starting at $50, which is below the bottomline price, to anchor the negotiation in my favor. 

I will proceed with sending a message first to express my interest and then make an initial offer.

Let's start the negotiation. 

Thought: I will send a message to the seller expressing interest in the item and indicate that I am open to negotiation. Then, I'll make an initial offer slightly below my bottomline price to start the negotiation with room for adjustment. 

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm very interested in The Godfather Trilogy [4K UHD]. Are you open to negotiating the price?")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=50.00, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest and proposed an offer of $50.00. My listing price is $90.99, and my bottomline price is $33.92. The offer of $50.00 does not meet my asking price, and there is room to negotiate towards a more favorable offer for me. I want to make a counteroffer slightly above the midpoint between their offer and my listing price to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range.

Code:
```py
# Calculate the midpoint between the buyer's offer and my listing price
midpoint_price = (50.0 + 90.99) / 2
counter_offer_price = round(midpoint_price, 2)

# Make a counter offer with the calculated price

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has responded with a counteroffer of $70.50 and has included free shipping. This offer is above my bottomline price of $63.65, so I'll need to negotiate further.

Since the current offer is above my limit, I cannot accept it, but I should acknowledge the offer positively to maintain a cooperative tone. I'll propose a counteroffer closer to my acceptable price range, perhaps around $60, considering the seller has already added free shipping. I'll make it clear that I'm close to my budget limit to manage expectations.

Thought: Acknowledge the seller's counteroffer and propose a counteroffer of $60. Indicate budget constraints to show my pricing limits while still keeping the negotiation open.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Thank you for the offer with free shipping. Unfortunately, that's a bit above my budget. I can go up to $60. Let me know if that works for you!")

Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $60.00, which shows willingness to negotiate. While the offer is still below my initial listing price of $90.99, it is higher than the previous offer and closer to a desirable range. Since the buyer has budget constraints, I can make a counteroffer slightly higher than $60 to maximize the selling price while remaining reasonable.

Code:
```py
# Increase the counteroffer slightly above the buyer's offer while considering their budget
counter_offer_price = 75.00

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has responded with a new offer of $75, still including free shipping. This offer remains above my bottomline price of $63.65, so I'll continue to negotiate.

I'll acknowledge the new offer and further emphasize my budget constraints. Since I've already stated $60, I'll increase slightly to $63.65, which is my absolute maximum. This will show that I am giving a final attempt and can't go any higher. I'll communicate clearly that this is my best possible offer.

Thought: Acknowledge the seller's new offer and make it clear that $63.65 is the highest I can go due to budget constraints.
