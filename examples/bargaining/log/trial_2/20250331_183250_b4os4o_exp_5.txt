            Here is your code snippet:
            I have sent a message to the buyer, reiterating the value of the collection and indicating that the offer of $60.00 remains the best possible deal from my side. I have also expressed understanding of their budget constraints and left the door open for future discussions if their situation changes.

With this message, I have maintained a professional tone and kept potential future negotiation possibilities open. At this point, if there are no further actions from the buyer, it seems we are at an impasse due to differing acceptable price ranges.
            Make sure to include code with the correct pattern, for instance:
            Thoughts: Your thoughts
            Code:
            ```py
            # Your python code here
            ```<end_code>
Make sure to provide correct code blobs.

Output message of the LLM:
To conclude this session properly, I should summarize the current state of negotiations and finalize any pending actions appropriately.

Thought: I have maintained the best offer I could, respecting the bottomline price. Since the buyer's budget doesn't align with the minimum price acceptable, it's likely best at this point to acknowledge the impasse in a professional manner and formally conclude this session.
Code:
```py
# Use a function to conclude the negotiation process due to reaching an impasse.
# Since an agreement wasn't reached and the buyer's budget is unaligned with the minimum price I can accept, it is best to conclude.
final_conclusion = quit_negotiation(agent_name="seller")

# Print the conclusion state
print(final_conclusion)
```

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has decided that $60.00 is their best offer and has ended the negotiation, maintaining their stance beyond my budgetary limit. Although a deal wasn't reached, I stayed within my constraints and handled the negotiation professionally. Since the seller has quit, I will finalize the negotiation process without an agreement.

```py
response = quit_negotiation(agent_name="buyer")
