The buyer's initial offer of $180 is significantly lower than my listing price of $349.99 and not acceptable as it is just slightly above half of the listing price. I need to negotiate effectively to bring the price closer to my listing while maintaining ample room for further negotiation. I will counteroffer and highlight the high value of the headset to justify my counteroffer price. I'll make a reasonable concession to show willingness to negotiate. 

**Counteroffer Strategy:**  
1. Counter at a price closer to the listing price, for instance, around $310.
2. Emphasize the premium features and quality of the headset to justify the price.
3. Mention the popularity or recommend adding a side offer like a warranty extension.
