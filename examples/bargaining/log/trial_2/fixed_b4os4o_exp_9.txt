Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer has expressed interest and is inquiring if the price is negotiable. This is an opportunity to maintain a strong stance while also indicating potential flexibility. I should emphasize the value of the product and highlight its features, yet also be open to negotiation to encourage the buyer to make an initial offer.

Here's how I will proceed:
1. Respond to the buyer by acknowledging their interest.
2. Highlight some key benefits of the product to reinforce its value.
3. Invite them to make an offer, subtly suggesting that the price can be discussed within reasonable boundaries.

Thought: I will send a message that emphasizes the product's benefits and suggests the buyer make an initial offer for discussion. 

Code:
```py
message = send_message(
    agent_name="seller",
    content=(
        "Hello! I'm glad to hear you're interested in the Garmin inReach Mini 2. "

Thought: The seller is open to discussing offers, which is a good sign. Now, I'll make an initial offer that is considerably below the listing price but above my bottomline price to leave room for negotiation. This will also signal my interest while providing some flexibility for adjustments.

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made an initial offer of $60.00 with a side offer of quick payment. This offer is significantly below the bottomline price of $291.61, and therefore cannot be accepted.

Here’s how I’ll proceed:
1. Quickly reject the current offer since it is not within an acceptable range.
2. Reaffirm the value and competitive nature of the listing price.
3. Encourage the buyer to consider a more reasonable offer.

Thought: I will reject the offer and communicate that the current offer is too low, while emphasizing the value of the product and inviting them to reconsider with a better offer.
