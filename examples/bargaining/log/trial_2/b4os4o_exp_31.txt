Thought: The buyer has made an initial offer of $2500. This offer is below my listing price of $2799.99 but above my bottomline price of $1560.73. To maximize my utility, I should counter with a higher price while emphasizing the value and features of the TV. I will make a counteroffer slightly below the listing price to encourage further negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has proposed a new offer of $2700, which includes free shipping. This offer is close to my bottomline price of $2678.85. To maximize my utility, I will make a counteroffer slightly below the current offer to see if there is any more flexibility from the seller.
