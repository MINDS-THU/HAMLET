======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To start the negotiation, I will send a message to express my interest in the item and inquire if the seller is open to negotiation. This will set a positive tone and indicate my intent to negotiate.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in the product and is asking if I'm open to negotiation. I should maintain a strong position by starting close to the listing price, while showing some willingness to negotiate. This will create room for adjustments later on, if necessary. I will send a message acknowledging their interest and make an initial offer slightly lower than the listing price to begin the negotiation process.

Code:
```py
# Send a message to the buyer acknowledging their interest and making an initial offer
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller with Charging Dock. I'm certainly open to negotiation. How about we start at $64.99?")
