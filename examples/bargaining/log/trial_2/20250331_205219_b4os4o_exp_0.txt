Thought: I've successfully communicated with the buyer, letting them know that the price is negotiable, and I've also made an initial offer of $399.99. Now, I will wait for the buyer's response to see if they accept, counter, or reject my offer. This will give me insights into how flexible or firm they are on their budget.

Thought: The seller has lowered their offer to $379.99, which is still above my maximum acceptable price. I need to make another counteroffer closer to my bottomline while expressing my constraints, which could motivate the seller to offer a more favorable price. I'll offer $220.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $220, which is still significantly below my counteroffer but shows a willingness to negotiate upwards. To move the negotiation forward, I'll propose a new price that's lower than the previous counteroffer but closer to it than to the buyer's offer. This balanced approach shows flexibility while maintaining the item's perceived value.
