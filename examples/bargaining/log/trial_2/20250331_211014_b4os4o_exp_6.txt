Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start by expressing interest in the product and making an initial offer. My offer should be below the seller's asking price to allow room for negotiation, but not too low to risk offending the seller unnecessarily. A good start would be around 30% below the listing price.

```py
initial_offer_price = 209.99  # This is approximately 30% below the listing price

# Send a message expressing interest and submit the initial offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in the Shark FlexStyle Air Styling & Drying System. Can we discuss the price?")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has made an initial offer of $209.99. My goal is to maximize my utility by securing a higher price. Given that my listing price is $299.99 and the bottomline price is $77.54, I need to negotiate strategically. I will make a counteroffer slightly lower than my listing price to demonstrate some flexibility while ensuring there's room for further negotiation. 

I will counter with a price of $279.99, highlighting the value of the product's unique features to justify the price.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 279.99
side_offer_message = "This styling system offers unique versatility with its full range of attachments, ensuring an all-in-one styling solution."
