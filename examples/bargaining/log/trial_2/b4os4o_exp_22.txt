Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made an offer of 750, which is below the listing price of 949.99 but above my bottomline price of 710.55. Since the buyer is willing to negotiate, I will counteroffer with a price slightly below the listing price to demonstrate some flexibility while still maintaining room to negotiate further if necessary.

### Counteroffer Strategy:
- Offer a price of 900, which is a small concession from the listing price.
- Highlight the quality and benefits of the vacuum cleaner to justify the value.
- Use the tactic of showing that there's limited flexibility moving forward.

Let's proceed with executing this plan.

```py
counter_price = 900
message_content = "Thank you for your interest in the Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum Cleaner. This model is one of the top performers in its category, offering exceptional cleaning power and versatility. I can offer it to you for $900, which is a competitive price given its features and support. Let me know if this works for you."

I appreciate the inclusion of a 2-year warranty and lifetime support but I need to negotiate further. I will counter this offer with a more enticing price of $600 to gradually approach my bottomline.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 600  # Lowering the offer to $600 to continue negotiations

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has countered with a significantly lower offer of 600, which is below my bottomline price of 710.55. It is essential to maintain the negotiation by expressing that their current offer is below an acceptable threshold and to reaffirm the value of the product.

### Response Strategy:
- Politely reject the offer of 600 as it is below my bottomline.
- Reiterate the value and premium features of the Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum Cleaner.
- Make another counteroffer, slightly reducing from my previous offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.

Let's proceed with implementing this strategy.

The buyer has once again increased their offer to 650, but this is still below my bottomline price of 710.55. It's critical to maintain my stance while trying to encourage the buyer to come closer to my acceptable range.
