Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To begin the negotiation, I will send a message to the seller expressing my interest and willingness to negotiate, and make an initial offer just below the listing price to start the conversation. This approach keeps room for adjustments and signals my interest in the item. 

Let's proceed with this strategy: 

Thought: I will send a message to the seller expressing interest in the Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells and make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to initiate negotiation.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in the Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells. Are you open to negotiation?")
print(message)

initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=300.0, side_offer=None)  # Starting below listing price
print(initial_offer)
```

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The initial message expressing interest in the Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells and the first offer of $300 have been successfully sent to the seller. 

Thought: I will now wait for the seller's response to the message and the initial offer. This will help us understand their position and willingness to negotiate further.

Code:
```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has expressed interest and made an initial offer of $300, which is significantly lower than my listing price of $379 and my bottomline price of $359.53. I need to respectfully counter this offer and try to anchor the negotiation closer to my listing price while highlighting the value of the dumbbells to justify a higher price.

**Code:**
```py
# Send a message to the buyer to acknowledge their interest and offer
acknowledge_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells. The dumbbells offer great versatility and can replace 15 sets of weights. Unfortunately, $300 is too low for me to accept. However, I am open to negotiation.")

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has responded, acknowledging the value of the Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells and offering a counter at $370 with free shipping. Given this response, there is some room to negotiate further.

Thought: I will appreciate the seller's offer, reiterate the budget constraint to create pressure for a better deal, and counter with an increased offer while still below my bottomline price. This approach maintains the negotiation's flow while showing my willingness to cooperate.

Code:
```py
