Output message of the LLM:
I received an offer from the buyer of $7.00, which is far below my bottomline price of $15.65. Therefore, I must reject this offer and make a counteroffer. It's important to anchor my price closer to the listing to show that I'm not willing to go that low. I will start by making a counteroffer slightly below the listing price to keep the negotiation going and leave room for both of us to adjust. 

I'll also send a message emphasizing the value of the item to justify my counteroffer.

Thought: I will reject the buyer's offer and make a counteroffer closer to the listing price. Additionally, I'll send a message to emphasize the value of the item for better positioning.

The buyer has increased their offer slightly to $8.30, which is still well below my bottomline price of $15.65. They also mentioned finding comparable options at lower prices, possibly as a negotiation tactic. It's important to remain firm yet flexible by adjusting the counteroffer slightly to maintain engagement.

I'll reject the current offer, make a counteroffer that nudges slightly lower from my last proposal and emphasize the value by mentioning aspects like the digital copy inclusion as extra value.

Thought: I will politely reject the buyer's offer and propose a slightly lower counteroffer to keep them engaged while reinforcing the unique value features of this product, such as the digital copy inclusion.
