Output message of the LLM:
I'll initiate the negotiation as a buyer for the EGO Power+ leaf blower. Let me start by greeting the seller and making an initial offer.

Thought: As a buyer, my strategy is to start with a lower initial offer that gives me room to negotiate upward. The listing price is $279.00 and my bottomline is $213.37. I'll start with an offer around 70% of the listing price, approximately $195, to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point. I'll also express interest in the product and inquire about its condition to build rapport with the seller.

Code:
```py
initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in your EGO Power+ leaf blower. It looks like a great product, but I'm working with a limited budget for yard equipment. Is the item in new condition? And are you open to negotiating on the price?")

response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
