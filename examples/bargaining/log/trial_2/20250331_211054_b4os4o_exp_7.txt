Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
To initiate the negotiation, I will start by sending a message expressing interest in the Nerf Zombie Strike Hammershot Blaster and also make an initial offer that is somewhat below the listing price to leave room for further negotiation. This initial offer will signal my seriousness about purchasing but will also keep room for adjustments as needed. Considering the listing price is $19.99, I will start the negotiation with an offer of $12.00.

**Code:**  
```py
# Initial message to seller expressing interest and making an initial offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the Nerf Zombie Strike Hammershot Blaster. Would you be open to negotiating the price?")
