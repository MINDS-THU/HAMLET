Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To start the negotiation, I will send a message showing my interest and make an initial offer slightly lower than the listing price to set the anchor and have room for negotiation. I will make the initial offer at $8.00, to open discussions.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The offer from the buyer is significantly lower than my listing price of $29.99 and even lower than my bottomline price of $20.78. This offer is unacceptable, but I need to keep the communication open and encourage the buyer to increase their offer. I will reject this offer and send a message indicating that I am unable to consider such a low price for this product while emphasizing its value and features, and suggesting that they come up with a better offer.

# Reject the current offer
