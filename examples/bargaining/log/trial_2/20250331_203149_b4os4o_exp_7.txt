Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To begin the negotiation, I will send a message to the seller to express my interest in the Matfer Bourgeat Black Carbon Steel Fry Pan and inquire about their flexibility in negotiating the listing price. This will set the stage for further discussion and indicate my interest in negotiating a favorable deal.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has initiated the negotiation by expressing their interest in the frying pan and asking if I'm open to negotiations. Since they are interested, I have room to start with a slightly firm offer close to the listing price while leaving room for future concessions. I'll maintain the value proposition by describing the product's unique features to justify the price, and make an offer close to the listing price.

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! Thank you for showing interest. This Matfer Bourgeat Black Carbon Steel Fry Pan is a top-quality item, perfect for various types of cooking and compatible with all HOB types.
