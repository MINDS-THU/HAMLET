Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will start by sending a friendly message to express my interest in the LEGO Wildflower Bouquet and inquire if the seller is open to negotiation. This will open the channel for further discussion.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the LEGO Icons Wildflower Bouquet set. Are you open to discussing the price?")
print(message)
```

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Now that I have sent an initial message, I will wait for the seller's response before proceeding with any offers or further negotiation.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is interested in negotiating the price for the LEGO set. I should respond positively to initiate the negotiation process. I can start by affirming my willingness to discuss and subtly hint at the item's value to set expectations for the negotiation.

Code:
```py
response = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! I'm glad you're interested in the LEGO Icons Wildflower Bouquet. It’s a unique item from the Botanical Collection. I'm open to discussing the price. Let's see what we can work out!")

======== seller ========
Execution logs:A message has been sent.
Out: None
======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Since I've informed the buyer that I'm open to negotiation, the next logical step is to make an initial offer. I'll start with a price slightly below the listing price to keep the negotiation moving, while still allowing room for compromise if needed.

Code:
```py
initial_offer_price = 54.99  # Starting slightly below the listing price
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=initial_offer_price, side_offer="Free shipping included")
print(offer)

Step 3
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I've made an initial offer with a slight reduction in price and included free shipping to make it more attractive. Now, I should wait for the buyer's response to see if they accept the offer, make a counteroffer, or have any other questions.

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has proposed a price of $54.99 with free shipping included. To negotiate effectively, I need to counter-offer at a lower price but make sure to keep the negotiation friendly. I will make an initial counter-offer below my bottom line to give us room to negotiate upwards. I will propose $40 and mention that I have a strict budget. 

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 40.00
counter_offer_message = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=counter_offer_price, side_offer="I'm on a tight budget, but I'm really interested in closing this deal.")

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's offer is significantly lower than the initial listing price and my first offer. However, they’re showing genuine interest by mentioning a tight budget. I need to counter with a price closer to my initially offered price while still offering the free shipping, ensuring it remains enticing yet profitable.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 49.99  # Closer to my initial offer but still a concession

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have made a counteroffer of $49.99, maintaining the appeal of free shipping. This price is still profitable for me and might be seen as a reasonable compromise by the buyer. I will wait for the buyer's response to see if they accept this offer or wish to negotiate further.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has come down to $49.99 with free shipping, showing some flexibility. I should counter-offer closer to my bottom line but still leave a little room for further negotiation. I will propose $42.27, which is my bottomline price, and emphasize that it's my final offer due to budget constraints.

Code:
```py
final_offer_price = 42.27

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has increased their offer slightly to $42.27, indicating they might be nearing their limit. My current offer of $49.99 is above this, but there may be room to meet closer to a middle ground. As their offer is still below my bottomline price of $35.97, I should aim to find an agreeable price while stressing the value and scarcity of the product.

Code:
```py
# Propose a new counteroffer near my previous one but slightly lower, while maintaining free shipping.
counter_offer_price = 46.99

offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=counter_offer_price, side_offer="Free shipping included. This is a premium, unique item, so it's a fantastic deal.")
