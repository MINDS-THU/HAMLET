Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I'll start the negotiation process by sending a friendly message to the seller to express my interest in the item. This will set a positive tone for the negotiation process and help build rapport with the seller.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer seems interested and is open to negotiating the price. I should respond positively to maintain engagement, but I will start by reaffirming the quality and value of the product. This will help justify my initial asking price while leaving room for negotiation later. I will then make my initial offer, close to the listing price but slightly lower to show willingness to negotiate.

Code:
```py
# Send a positive response to the buyer's interest while highlighting product value
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Hello! I'm glad you're interested in the TOTO WASHLET C5 Bidet Toilet Seat. It's a highly valued product known for its advanced features and eco-friendly design. I can consider a slight reduction in price. Let's work together to reach a satisfactory agreement.")

# Make an initial offer, slightly lower than the listing price, to start the negotiation
initial_offer_price = 805.0  # Slightly lower than the listing price

Step 1

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has expressed willingness to negotiate and provided an offer of $805, which is below the listing price but still above my bottomline price of $797.73. I will make a counteroffer slightly below my maximum to communicate negotiation intent while maintaining some room for adjustments if needed.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 797.73  # Just at the upper limit of my budget

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has made a counteroffer of $797.73, which is below my initial offer but still above my bottomline price. I should consider responding with a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than the buyer's current offer, to continue the negotiation. By doing this, I can aim to maximize my utility while moving closer to an agreeable price.

Code:
```py
# Making a counteroffer that is slightly above the buyer's current offer to continue negotiation
counteroffer_price = 800.0  # A strategic point between the initial offer and the buyer's offer

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have successfully made a counteroffer at $800.00, which is slightly higher than the buyer's last offer. Now, I should wait for the buyer's response to see if they accept the counteroffer or respond with another counteroffer. This will help to further gauge their willingness to negotiate and settle at a price.

This offer is above my bottomline price of $772.28, but slightly below the counteroffer I made. Given that they are expressing a strong budget constraint and it's close to my acceptable range, it might be wise to accept this offer in the interest of securing a deal, ensuring I still achieve a positive utility.
