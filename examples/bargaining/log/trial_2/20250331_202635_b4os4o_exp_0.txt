I will then make an initial offer significantly lower than the listing price to open the negotiation and leave room for adjustments.

I'll explain my offer by expressing a limited budget.

I'll propose a final offer near my bottomline price to test if the buyer can barely stretch a little more, while making it clear this is my last possible offer.
