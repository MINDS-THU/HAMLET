Given the buyer's initial offer of $1350, we have room to negotiate. Our initial listing price is $1497.99, and we must not drop below our bottomline price of $440.37. A strategic move would be to counter with a slightly lower price than our listing price but higher than the buyer's offer, starting the negotiation with an anchor above their initial offer.

### Plan:
1. Decline the initial offer politely.
2. Make a counteroffer closer to our asking price, while emphasizing the unique value of the TV, such as its art mode and QLED technology.
3. Set the counteroffer at $1450 to keep it attractive yet beneficial.

The buyer has increased their offer to $1380, which is closer to our asking price but still below the counteroffer made at $1450. To maintain some flexibility and show willingness to negotiate, I should make a further concession, but one that also reinforces the value of the TV.

### Plan:
1. Politely reject the offer of $1380.
2. Make a new counteroffer slightly closer to the buyerâ€™s offer to show goodwill and flexibility, possibly around $1425.
3. Reiterate the exceptional value of the TV, potentially offering an additional incentive like free shipping to make the offer more appealing.
