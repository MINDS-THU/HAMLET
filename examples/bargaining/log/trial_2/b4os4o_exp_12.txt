Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is interested in the fragrance and wants to negotiate the price. It's important to start with a strong initial position but also show willingness to negotiate. I will respond positively to their inquiry and propose an initial offer slightly below the listing price to initiate the negotiation. This approach allows room for adjustments while still positioning it in the seller's favor.

Code:
```py

I need to propose a counteroffer that brings us closer to our goal while still retaining negotiation flexibility. I will counter with a price higher than theirs to anchor the negotiation back towards the listing price while acknowledging their commitment to prompt payment.
