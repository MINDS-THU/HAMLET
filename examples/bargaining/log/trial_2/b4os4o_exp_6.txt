Let's try this again by outlining the plan before moving into the code.

Thought: I'll begin by sending a message to the seller expressing interest in the De'Longhi Espresso Machine and inquiring if they are open to negotiate. Then, I'll set up an initial offer below the listing price to start the negotiation process.

Code:
```py
# Sending an initial message to express interest and check if the seller is open to negotiation
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi there! I'm interested in the De'Longhi ECP3420 Espresso Machine. Would you be open to negotiating the price?")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has expressed interest and made an initial offer of $150. This is below the listing price of $207.95 but above the bottomline price of $117.01. It's a fair starting point for negotiation. I should counter their offer by proposing a higher price while still staying within a reasonable range to show flexibility. I'll make a counteroffer at $190 to continue the negotiation while maintaining communication towards a fair agreement.

Thought: I will propose a new offer at $160, which shows my interest in negotiating but keeps me comfortably below the bottomline price.

Thought: I will offer $165, which demonstrates some flexibility and may encourage the seller to lower their price further.
