======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's initial offer of $30.0 is below my bottomline price of $36.2, so I cannot accept it. To initiate the negotiation and move toward a more acceptable price, I will counter with a value that's closer to the listing price to maintain room for concessions.

### Counterproposal Strategy:
1. **Counter Offer:** I'll propose a price slightly below the listing price to signal willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the item's value.
2. **Use Psychological Leverage:** I will emphasize the high-demand nature of the item to create urgency.
3. **Offer Additional Incentives:** I'll offer free shipping to make the deal more attractive without reducing the price further.

Let's proceed with these steps:

### Thought Process:
- Counter the buyer's offer with a price of $78.0.
- Highlight the quality and demand for the tool set.
- Offer free shipping as an additional incentive. 

### Action Plan:
1. Counter the offer at $78.0 with free shipping.
2. Send a message emphasizing the product's demand and value.

```py
# Making counter offer
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=78.0, side_offer="Free shipping")
print(offer)

# Sending a persuasive message
message_content = (
    "Thank you for your interest in the Amazon Basics Mechanic's Tool Socket Set. "
    "This item is in high demand due to its exceptional quality and value. "
    "To make the transaction smoother, I'm offering free shipping. "
    "I hope you find this deal suitable."
)
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content=message_content)
print(message)
```

    "This item is in high demand due to its exceptional quality and value. "
    "To make the transaction smoother, I'm offering free shipping. "
    "I hope you find this deal suitable."

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content=message_content)

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
I have successfully sent a new counteroffer to the buyer at a price of $78.0, including free shipping, and also provided a message emphasizing the quality and demand for the socket set.

### Next Steps:
I will now wait for the buyer's response to see how they react to this counteroffer. This will give us better insights into their pricing flexibility and interest level.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with a price of $78 and offered free shipping. While this is a reduction from the listing price, it is still significantly above my bottomline price. I should continue negotiating to bring the price down closer to my acceptable range. I'll make a slightly improved offer to show willingness to negotiate, but still keep it well within my budgetary limits.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 35.00  # A slight increase from my previous offer but below my bottomline
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=counter_offer_price, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's latest offer of $35.0 is still below my bottomline price of $36.2. However, they have significantly increased their initial offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate.

### Counterproposal Strategy:
1. **Close the Gap**: Make a counteroffer that is still above my bottomline but closer to $36.2 to demonstrate good faith negotiation.
2. **Maintain Benefits**: Continue offering free shipping to add value.
3. **Signal Firmness**: Indicate that the new offer is approaching my limit to encourage acceptance.

### Action Plan:
1. Propose a counteroffer at $40.0 with the continued offer of free shipping.
2. Communicate that this offer reflects my willingness to come close to their expectations.

```py
# Making counter offer
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=40.0, side_offer="Free shipping")
print(counter_offer)

# Sending a message to illustrate the negotiation stance
message_content = (
    "I've adjusted the offer to $40.0 with free shipping included to show my willingness to work with you. "

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with a price of $40 with free shipping. This offer is very close to my bottomline price of $37.76. Given that my utility would be negative if I paid more than my bottomline price, I need to try to get a slightly better deal. I'll make a final counteroffer just below my bottomline price to see if the seller is willing to meet me there.

Code:

The buyer's new offer of $37.76 is now above my bottomline price of $36.2 and is quite close to the $40.0 counteroffer I made earlier. This represents a reasonable deal for both parties.

### Decision:
- **Accept the Offer:** The price of $37.76 provides me with a utility of $37.76 - $36.2 = $1.56, which is acceptable.

### Action Plan:
1. Accept the buyer's offer of $37.76.
2. Confirm the agreement and reiterate the benefit of free shipping.

# Accepting the buyer's offer
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)
