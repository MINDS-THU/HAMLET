Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I'll send a message to the seller to express interest in the item and indicate that I'm willing to negotiate. This will help establish communication and pave the way for an initial offer. Additionally, I will prepare an initial offer below the seller's asking price to create room for negotiation.

Code:
```py
# Sending a message to the seller to initiate negotiation
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the Apple MagSafe Charger. Are you open to negotiation?")
print(message)

# Making an initial offer below the seller's asking price

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating for the Apple MagSafe Charger but has made an initial offer of $20. This price is below my bottomline price of $23.02, so I can't accept this offer. I should politely reject this offer and make a counteroffer slightly below the listing price to encourage further negotiation while signaling my willingness to work towards a deal. 

I will aim to make a counteroffer at $37 to keep the negotiation active and leave room for further negotiation moves if necessary.

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=37.0, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has rejected my initial offer and proposed a new offer of $37.0. Since this price is still significantly above my bottomline of $15.59, I'll need to make a counteroffer that is closer to my acceptable range. I'll present a slightly higher offer than my initial one to show willingness to negotiate while reinforcing my budget constraints.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has responded with a new offer of $22, which is still below my bottomline price of $23.02. I need to reject this offer since it doesn't meet my minimum acceptable price. I should make a counteroffer that is still attractive but pushes the buyer closer to my desired range. I'll propose a price of $35, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but still prioritizing my interests.

Thought: The seller has rejected my counteroffer and has lowered their offer to $35.0. Although this shows some flexibility, it is still above my bottomline of $15.59.
