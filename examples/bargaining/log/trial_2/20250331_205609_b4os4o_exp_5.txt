Certainly! The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating the price for the Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Pro tablet. My strategy will be to start with a counteroffer closer to the listing price and see if the buyer is willing to accept it or come closer to it. I will emphasize the value of the tablet and the benefits included to justify the price. I'll also ensure to leave some room for further negotiation.

**Initial Plan:**
1. Send a positive message acknowledging their interest.
2. Make a counteroffer slightly below the listing price to initiate the negotiation and show willingness to negotiate.

I'll proceed with this plan.

In response, I will employ the tactic of making a counteroffer while emphasizing the high-value aspects of the tablet such as the 1-year subscription to Amazon Kids+, parental controls, and the 2-year worry-free guarantee. This will help justify a higher price.

I will:
1. Politely reject the $70 offer.

3. Emphasize the product's value.
