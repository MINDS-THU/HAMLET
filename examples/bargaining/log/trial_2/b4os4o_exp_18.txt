### **Negotiation Analysis and Response Planning**

#### **Buyer's Initial Offer:** 
- **Offered Price:** $68
- **Listing Price:** $84
- **Bottomline Price (Seller's Minimum Acceptable Price):** $78.57

#### **Analysis:**
The buyer's offer of $68 is significantly lower than both our listing price and our bottomline price. Accepting this offer would result in a negative utility for us. Therefore, it's essential to negotiate a price closer to our minimum acceptable price of $78.57.

#### **Strategy:**
1. **Counteroffer:** 
   - Propose a counteroffer that's reasonable and somewhat higher than our bottomline price. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
2. **Value Justification:** 
   - Highlight the benefits and quality of the DEWALT LED Work Light to justify our price.

#### **Immediate Plan:**
- Counter the buyer's offer with a new price.
- Emphasize the value of the product and explain why the price offered is reasonable.

Let's proceed with this plan by making a counteroffer.
