Thought: The buyer's offer of $10.0 is below my listing price of $14.24, but it is above my bottomline price of $7.69. I should counter with a higher offer to show firmness but also openness to negotiation while emphasizing the value of the product. I will counter with a price slightly below the listing price to encourage a bit more engagement from the buyer.
