Output message of the LLM:
To maximize my utility, I need to engage the buyer and start the negotiation process. I will begin by responding positively to their inquiry about negotiating the price, which will set an encouraging tone for the negotiation. Then, I will make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to keep room for negotiation while not going too low to protect my utility.

Thought: I will send a welcoming message to express openness to negotiation and make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to start the negotiation.

Code:

To strategically anchor the negotiation in my favor, I will make a counteroffer significantly lower than the seller's offer while still above my bottomline to give room to negotiate further. I'll also mention my budget constraints to strengthen my position.

The buyer's offer of $30.00 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $86.11.

I will make a counteroffer closer to my initial price to start bridging the gap.

Thought: I will politely inform the buyer that $30.00 is too low and propose a counteroffer more suitable. Additionally, I'll emphasize the value of the product to justify the counteroffer.
