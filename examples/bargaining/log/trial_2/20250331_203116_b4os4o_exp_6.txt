Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start the negotiation by expressing interest in the item and making an initial offer significantly below the listing price but higher than my bottomline price. This will leave room for further negotiation and signal my willingness to reach a fair agreement.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello, I'm interested in purchasing the Pixobitz Studio. I noticed the listing price is $29.99. Would you consider an offer of $10?")
print(message)

Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Since I have already sent the initial message, the next step is to wait for the response from the seller. This will help me understand their stance and how they might respond to my initial offer.

Code:
```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
```
======== buyer ========
Executing parsed code:
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")

======== buyer ========
Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! The buyer's initial offer of $10 is below my bottomline price of $13.17, so I cannot accept this. I will start by making a counteroffer slightly higher than my bottomline price to leave some room for negotiation. I'll highlight the value of the product to justify the price.

Thought: I'll make a counteroffer at $25, emphasizing the creativity and unique value that the Pixobitz Studio offers. This price gives me room to make further concessions if necessary, while still starting reasonably close to the market value.

Code:
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=25, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```
======== seller ========
Executing parsed code:
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=25, side_offer=None)

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
I've made a counteroffer at $25, which reflects the unique value and quality of the Pixobitz Studio. Now, I will wait for the buyer to respond to this offer.

Thought: I will wait for the buyer's response to my counteroffer so I can adjust my strategy based on their next move.

Code:
```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")
print(response)

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has proposed a price of $25, which is still significantly above my target price of $13.61. I'll counter their offer by proposing a higher amount than my initial offer yet still below my bottomline to signal flexibility while keeping the focus on negotiations. 

Code:
```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=12, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)
```
======== buyer ========

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Now that I have made a counter offer of $12, I will wait for the seller's response. This will allow me to gauge their willingness to negotiate further.

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's new offer of $12 is still below my bottomline price of $13.17. Therefore, it cannot be accepted. I need to counter with a price that is above my bottomline but still attractive to the buyer.

Thought: I will provide a counteroffer at $20, reiterating the value and benefits of the Pixobitz Studio. This shows flexibility and encourages the buyer to move closer to a reasonable price.

Code:
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=20, side_offer=None)
print(offer)
```
======== seller ========
Executing parsed code:
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=20, side_offer=None)

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
I've made a counteroffer at $20, which remains above my bottomline price while being significantly lower than the initial listing. Now, I'll wait for the buyer to respond to this updated offer.

Thought: I'll wait for the buyer's response, as they may either accept the offer or propose a new one. This will help me determine the next step in the negotiation.

Out - Final step: Waiting for the opponent's response.
======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has come down to $20, indicating a willingness to negotiate. Since the price is still above my acceptable range, I'll make another counter-offer which is closer to my bottomline but still strategically lower, to try and reach a mutual agreement.

Code:
```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=13.50, side_offer=None)

Step 2

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer's latest offer is $13.5, which is slightly above my bottomline price of $13.17. This means the offer can be accepted as it exceeds my minimum acceptable price and maximizes my utility within the constraints.

Thought: I'll accept the current offer of $13.5 as it meets my bottomline requirement and concludes the negotiation successfully.
