======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Before starting the negotiation, I will lay out an initial plan to approach the seller strategically.

### Plan:
1. **Send a message** showing interest in the product and opening the conversation for negotiation.
2. **Make an initial offer** significantly lower than the listing price but within a reasonable range to leave room for further negotiation. My initial offer will be aggressive but not so low as to be dismissed outright.

By approaching in this manner, I aim to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point while gauging the seller's flexibility.

Let's begin with the first step:

Thought: I will send a message to express my interest in the Google Pixel Buds Pro and inquire if the seller is open to negotiation.
Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the Google Pixel Buds Pro. Are you open to negotiating the price?")
print(message)
```

======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The initial message to the seller has been sent, expressing interest in the Google Pixel Buds Pro and inquiring about the possibility of negotiating the price. Now, let's wait for the seller's response to see if they are open to negotiation.

Thought: I will now wait for the seller's response to my initial message.
Code:
```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)
```

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is showing interest in the product and is asking about the possibility of negotiating the price. To start the negotiation and anchor the price favorably for myself as the seller, I will reaffirm the product's value and then make an initial offer slightly below the listing price. This will signal my willingness to negotiate while keeping room for further adjustments if needed.

Code:
```py
# Responding to the buyer's interest and making an initial offer slightly below the listing price.
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the Google Pixel Buds Pro! They are a fantastic choice with premium features. I am open to negotiation. Let's get started with an initial offer.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
The seller has responded and is open to negotiation, which creates a positive environment for us. Their initial offer is $189.99, which is still quite high compared to our target price.

### Plan:
1. **Counter the seller's offer** with a significantly lower price, close to our bottomline threshold, but not too low as to offend.
2. I will offer $60 as a counteroffer, a reasonable starting point, and make it clear that I have budget constraints.

This counteroffer will leverage the scope for further negotiations while signaling our price expectations.

Thought: Let's make a counteroffer of $60, emphasizing budget constraints.
Code:
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=60, side_offer="I have a tight budget but would love to make a deal.")

Thought: The buyer has made a counteroffer at $60, which is significantly below my bottomline price of $124.65. This offer is unacceptable. I need to reject this offer while reiterating the value of the product and suggesting a more reasonable counteroffer. This approach will help guide the negotiation towards a more mutually acceptable price.

The seller has rejected my initial counteroffer of $60 but has made another offer at $179.99. Though it's better than the original, it's still much higher than my acceptable range.

### Plan:
1. **Further negotiate** by providing another counteroffer closer to my max budget limit to signal seriousness.
2. Offer $70, stressing my financial restrictions while expressing appreciation for their consideration.

This approach keeps the communication open while reinforcing my budget constraints.

Thought: Make another counteroffer at $70, emphasizing the budgetary limits again.
