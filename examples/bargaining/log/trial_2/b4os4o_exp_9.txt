Thought: I will start the negotiation by expressing interest in the product and making an initial offer below the listing price. This will allow some room for negotiation while anchoring the discussion on a lower price point.

Step 1

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer’s initial offer of 380 is below my bottomline price of 406.62. I will need to reject this offer while providing a counteroffer that is closer to the listing price of 499.99. By doing so, I can anchor the negotiation around a higher price point while remaining open to further negotiation. I’ll provide additional value by offering free shipping as part of my counteroffer.

**Code:**
```py
# Reject the buyer's initial offer and provide a counteroffer with free shipping
response_to_offer = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

Thought: The seller has made a counteroffer of $485 with free shipping. This is significantly above my maximum price of $421.33. I will make a counteroffer closer to my maximum price while acknowledging the free shipping offer to keep the negotiation amicable.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:** The buyer has increased their offer to 405 and added free shipping, which shows they're interested in the product but are still slightly below my bottomline price of 406.62. I should counter with a small concession to demonstrate flexibility while bringing the price just above my bottomline. I will propose a price of 420 with free shipping to see if we can move closer to an agreement.

# Counteroffer with a price slightly above the bottomline while maintaining free shipping
