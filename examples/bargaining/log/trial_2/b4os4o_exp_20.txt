Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
The buyer has expressed interest and made an offer of $800. While this is below the listing price of $899.95, it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer to demonstrate flexibility while aiming to secure a better price. I can also emphasize the product's value to justify a higher counteroffer.

**Action:**  
I will make a counteroffer slightly below the listing price but above the buyer's initial offer to start the negotiation process and maintain leverage.

I will wait for the buyer's response to the counteroffer.

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
The buyer has lowered their offer to $700, which suggests they might be testing my willingness to negotiate further. This offer is significantly below my bottom line of $355.25 and the previous offers. I should respond with a message explaining the value of the product to justify a higher price and possibly make another counteroffer that is still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Action:**  
I will communicate the value of the espresso machine to the buyer and propose a new counteroffer.

**Code:**
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="The De'Longhi Magnifica Evo offers an exceptional espresso experience with its advanced features. Given its value, I can offer it to you for $850. This is a great deal considering its capabilities and the convenience it brings to your home.")

Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
The buyer has increased their offer to $730, showing some flexibility and willingness to negotiate upwards. This progress is encouraging, but the offer is still below my previous counteroffer of $850. I should acknowledge their movement and try to bridge the gap by making a counteroffer slightly above their current offer to maintain negotiation momentum.

**Action:**  
I will make a counteroffer of $820 to meet the buyer partway and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

The buyer has increased their offer to $760, showing a willingness to move closer to my asking price. This is good progress, and it might be time for me to make a small concession to finalize the deal. I should emphasize the quality and value of the machine again while proposing a final price that is close to what the buyer offered.

**Action:**  
I will propose a final offer of $800, which is slightly below my last counteroffer but higher than the buyer's current offer, aiming to close the deal.
