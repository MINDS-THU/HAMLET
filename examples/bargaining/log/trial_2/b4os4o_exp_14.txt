Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To initiate the negotiation, I will send a message to express interest in the item and indicate that I am open to a discussion on the price. This sets a positive tone and opens the floor for negotiation.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Sure, I'm prepared to negotiate. I'm aiming to maximize the selling price, but I also need to keep the buyer engaged. My initial price point should be firm but slightly flexible. I'll begin negotiations with a price just below the listing price to show some willingness to negotiate.

Let's propose an initial offer.

Thought: I'll send an initial offer to the buyer, slightly below the listing price, while emphasizing the value of the product. This will serve as an anchor for our negotiation.

Code:
```py
offer_price = 31.99  # Slightly below the listing price of 33.99
side_offer_message = "This classic holiday comedy is a must-have for your collection!"
offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=offer_price, side_offer=side_offer_message)

Output message of the LLM:
I've made an initial offer to the buyer for the 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (4K Ultra HD + Blu-Ray + Digital)' priced at $31.99, highlighting its value as a classic holiday comedy. 

Now, I'll wait for the buyer's response to my offer.

Thought: I should wait for the buyer's response to see how they react to the initial offer. This will help in deciding the next steps in our negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has offered a price of $31.99 with a side note emphasizing the value of the item. My goal is to negotiate this price down to something more favorable, ideally below my bottomline price of $22.44.

Thought: I will make a counteroffer at a lower price to start the negotiation process. I will counter with a price that is slightly above my absolute bottomline, around $20, to leave room for further negotiation.
```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=20.00, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has countered with an offer of $20. This is quite below my initial offer of $31.99, but there's room to negotiate further towards my acceptable range. 

To maintain a firm stance while showing some flexibility, I'll make a counteroffer slightly closer to the buyer's offer but still above what they proposed.

Thought: I'll counter with a new offer at a reasonable midpoint to keep the negotiation moving, demonstrating both firmness and willingness to compromise. I will emphasize the high quality of the package to justify my counteroffer.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 27.99  # A midpoint to encourage further negotiation
side_offer_message = "This includes the 4K UHD, Blu-Ray, and Digital versions. Ideal for any film lover!"

Thought: I'll pause and wait for the buyer's next move, as it's crucial to see whether they accept, further counter, or propose any new terms.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has significantly reduced the price to $27.99, which is closer to my target range, yet still above my absolute maximum of $22.44. I need to make another counteroffer to get it closer to my target price.

Thought: To move closer to an agreement, I will make a counteroffer at $22, which is very close to my bottomline price. This should convey that I am nearing my limit.
```py

Output message of the LLM:
The buyer has made a slight increase to their offer, moving up to $22.00. This indicates some willingness to negotiate further. However, this price is still below my last offer.

To keep the negotiation going and signal that I am considering their position, I'll make another counteroffer, slightly reducing my price to show some flexibility.

Thought: I'll make another counteroffer a bit lower than my previous one to indicate consideration of the buyer's stance while still emphasizing the value proposition.

Code:
```py
counter_offer_price = 26.50  # Slightly lower than the previous offer

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has responded with a price of $26.5, which is still above my maximum limit of $22.44. I need to convey that my previous offer was essentially my final offer.

Thought: I will emphasize that my previous offer of $22 is the maximum I can pay and suggest that if they cannot accept it, I may have to reconsider my options.
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Thank you for your offer. I must be honest, $22 is genuinely the highest I can offer considering my budget constraints. If this can't work, I might need to explore other options.")

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
The buyer is indicating that $22 is their maximum offer due to budget constraints. This signals that they might be nearing their limit, but they could potentially accept a slightly better offer if it appears to be a compromise.

Given that my bottomline is $10.04 and the buyer has shown an interest in reaching a deal, I should attempt a final offer just above their stated budget, aiming for an agreement that's beneficial for both. If I manage to get them closer to my counteroffer, it will still be lucrative considering my bottomline.

Thought: I will express understanding of their budget constraints and make a final offer slightly above their maximum offer. This will be presented as a special concession to close the deal.

Code:
```py
final_offer_price = 24.50  # A slight increase from the buyer's maximum offer
side_offer_message = "I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make a final offer to meet you halfway. This is truly the best deal for such a valuable collection."
