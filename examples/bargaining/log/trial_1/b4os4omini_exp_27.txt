Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To begin the negotiation, I will send a message to the seller expressing interest in the Segway Ninebot S-Max Smart Self-Balancing Electric Scooter and inquire if they are open to negotiation. I will then make an initial offer that's significantly lower than the listing price but above my bottomline to start the conversation, while leaving room for adjustments.

Code:
```py
# Send a message to express interest and inquire about negotiation possibility
