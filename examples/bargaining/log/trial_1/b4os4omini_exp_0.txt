Output message of the LLM:
I'm ready to start negotiating for the solar string lights. To kick off the negotiation, it's crucial to anchor the conversation with an initial offer well below the listing price, allowing room for adjustment while staying far from my bottomline price. I will also send a message expressing my interest in the product.  

I will propose an initial offer of $25, which gives plenty of room to negotiate up but is a noticeable deviation from the listing price of $70. This signals to the seller that there's significant room for negotiation.

Let's begin by sending a message expressing my interest and making the initial offer.

To start the negotiation, I'll send a message expressing my interest in the item and make an initial offer that is significantly lower than the listing price to provide room for negotiation. 

Here's the plan:

2. Make an initial offer of $25.

Now, let's execute this.

Thought: The buyer has shown interest in purchasing the Luci Solar String Lights and has proposed a price of 25.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has expressed a willingness to negotiate and aims to find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. With the initial offer of $25 rejected, it is time to make a counteroffer. Given that the seller is asking for $70 and has not suggested a specific counteroffer, I will increase my offer, but still keep it well below the listing price to maintain negotiation space. 

A reasonable strategy could be to offer $30 to continue the negotiations but still reflect my position as a cost-sensitive buyer. I should also mention that I have a strict budget, reinforcing the notion of limited flexibility.

Thought: Make a counteroffer at $30 and mention a strict budget to convey limited flexibility.
Code:
```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=30, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)
