Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To initiate the negotiation, I will send a message to the seller expressing my interest in the item and ask if they are open to negotiation. This will set the stage for us to start negotiating the price. Once I have their response, I can make my initial offer.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest and is open to negotiation, which is a positive sign. I will respond affirmatively to show willingness to negotiate and establish an initial asking price. This will set the stage for the negotiation. I will suggest the listing price of 60.0 to begin with.  
Code:
```py

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has expressed openness to negotiate from the initial asking price of $60. To start the negotiation, I'll make an offer significantly lower than the asking price but still reasonable, leaving room for further negotiation. I’ll start with an offer of $20, signaling room for further conversation.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer's offer of $20 is significantly below the listing price of $60, and it's also below my bottom line. I need to reject this offer firmly, but I will do so politely to keep the negotiation open and encourage the buyer to come back with a higher offer.

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have rejected the buyer's offer of $20. Now, I will send a follow-up message to reiterate my position and encourage the buyer to propose a more reasonable price. I want to keep the dialogue open while hinting that the asking price is negotiable but needs to be higher than $20. I'll suggest a range closer to my bottom line but still above it. I will recommend a starting point of $45.  
Code:
```py
follow_up_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your offer, but $20 is too low for this game. I am looking for something more in the range of $45 or higher. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.")

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with a suggestion for the price to be $45 or higher. Since this is still above my highest acceptable price of $27.09, I will make a counteroffer of $25 to continue negotiating. This counteroffer is reasonable and closer to my bottom line but still provides room for further negotiations.

Step 1

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has raised their offer to $25, which is still below my acceptable range. While the increase is a step in the right direction, I need to reject this offer as well. I will respond politely and encourage them to come back with a proposal closer to my indicated range of $45 or higher. This keeps the negotiation open without compromising my bottom line.
