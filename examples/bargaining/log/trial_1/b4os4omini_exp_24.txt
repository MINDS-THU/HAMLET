Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To begin the negotiation process, I'll send a message to the seller to express my interest in the item and see if they are open to negotiation. Additionally, I will make an initial offer that is slightly lower than the listing price to start the conversation.

Thought: I'll send a message to the seller to express interest in the item and make an initial offer of $35, which is below the listing price but above my bottomline price, to start the negotiation.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the LEGO Star Wars Luke Skywalker’s X-wing Fighter. Are you open to discussing the price?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating the price for the LEGO Star Wars X-wing Fighter and has proposed an initial offer of $35. While this is significantly below my listing price of $49.99, it's my responsibility to start the negotiation by rejecting this low offer and countering with a more favorable price. I will aim to propose a price that still reflects the value of the item, likely in the range of $45 to $49.99 to keep the negotiations progressing positively. 

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)  # Reject the offer

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has rejected my initial offer of $35 and responded with a counteroffer of $45, which is still above my bottomline price of $27.57. I need to continue negotiating to reach a more favorable price.

Thought: I will make a higher counteroffer, moving progressively closer to my bottomline price. I will offer $30 to show flexibility while maintaining some room for further negotiation.

Thought: The buyer has responded with a new offer of $30, which is still below my counteroffer of $45. I will reject this offer as well, as it doesn't align with my pricing expectations. My goal is to continue to negotiate but also give the buyer a sense that I'm moving closer to an acceptable price. I can consider adjusting my counteroffer to $40 to keep the negotiation attractive while still aiming for a higher sale price.
