Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To initiate the negotiation, I'll begin by expressing interest in the item and then make a reasonable initial offer that's lower than the listing price to leave room for adjustments.

I'll send a message to the seller to express my interest in the product, and then make an initial offer. Let's proceed with that.

Thought: I want to show interest and start the negotiation process. I'll submit an initial offer slightly below the listing price, perhaps around $150, to give us room for negotiation.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D. Would you be open to negotiation?")

This offer is unacceptable. I will send a message indicating my appreciation for their interest while firmly rejecting the current offer and suggesting that we can negotiate further, starting with a counteroffer above the proposed price.
