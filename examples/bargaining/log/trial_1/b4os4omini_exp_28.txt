Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I'll start the negotiation by expressing interest and making an initial offer slightly below the listing price to give room for counteroffers. This will set the tone and provide an anchor point for the negotiation.

message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in purchasing the Safer Home SH502 Indoor Plug-In Fly Trap. Would you be open to negotiating the price?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating the price and made an initial offer of $8.00. Since this price is significantly below my listing price of $17.99, I will reject this offer to reaffirm the value of the item while maintaining room for negotiation. I will then make a counteroffer that is closer to my asking price, aiming to negotiate upwards from their initial offer. 

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=15.99, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have successfully rejected the buyer’s initial offer of $8.00 and made a counteroffer of $15.99. This is still lower than my listing price, allowing for further negotiation while indicating my willingness to engage. Now, I will wait for a response from the buyer to see how they react to my counteroffer.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has countered with a new offer closer to their initial listing price. To strategically negotiate while signaling our budget constraint, I'll make a counteroffer slightly higher than my initial offer but still below their current offer, while hinting at limited alternatives.

Code:
```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=9.00, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:

I will reject this offer to maintain the value of the item and make another counteroffer that illustrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. I will propose $14.99 as my new counteroffer.
