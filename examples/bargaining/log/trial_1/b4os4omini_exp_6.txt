======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! As a buyer, it's important to start the negotiation process by expressing interest and initiating a conversation with the seller. I will start by sending a message to the seller and then make an initial offer below the listing price to open negotiations.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller to express my interest in the Echo Show 5 and make an initial offer to start the negotiation. I will offer $45 as an anchor to leave room for adjustments.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the All-new Echo Show 5. Are you open to negotiations?")
print(message)

initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=45, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:
The message expressing interest in the Echo Show 5 has been sent to the seller, and the initial offer of $45 has been proposed to start the negotiation. I'll now wait for the seller's response.

Thought: I will wait for the seller's response to either my message or initial offer. This will allow me to decide on the next step based on their reaction.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has reached out and expressed interest in negotiating. However, their offer of $45 is significantly below my acceptable limit of $48.14 for the All-new Echo Show 5, so I need to reject this offer while remaining polite and open to further negotiation. I will send a message indicating that the proposed price is too low and that I am willing to negotiate closer to my listing price of $89.99. 

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest! The offer of $45 is below my acceptable limit. I am open to negotiating closer to my listing price of $89.99. What are your thoughts?")

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has rejected my initial offer of $45 and is encouraging negotiations closer to their listing price of $89.99. I must strategically counter to make progress while keeping my bottomline price in mind.

Thought: I'll slightly increase my offer to $48 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate but still maintain leverage by mentioning I have a strict budget. This tactic can encourage a more favorable counteroffer from the seller.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $48, which is only slightly above my absolute bottom line of $48.14.
