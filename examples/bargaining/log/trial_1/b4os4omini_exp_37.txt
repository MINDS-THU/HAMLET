Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start the negotiation by expressing interest in the product and making an initial offer. Let's make this initial offer well below the listing price but above my bottomline price to leave room for counteroffers. I'll offer $45 as a starting point, while highlighting my genuine interest. This allows me to later increase my offer if needed, approaching my maximum limit.

Code:
```py
initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hi! I'm interested in the 3M WorkTunes Connect + Gel Ear Cushions Hearing Protector. Would you consider negotiating on the price?")
print(initial_message)

initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=45.00, side_offer=None)
print(initial_offer)
```

Step 2
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have sent both a message expressing interest in the item and an initial offer of $45. Now, I will wait for the seller's response to see how they react to my initial offer or if they provide any counteroffer or message. This will help me strategize my next move based on their reaction.

Code:
```py
response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(response)

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest and made an initial offer of **$45.00**, which is significantly below my listing price of **$89.99** and also lower than my bottom line of **$50.07**. I must reject this initial offer to keep the negotiations going and maintain my position. I'll also respond positively to indicate I'm open to negotiation while suggesting a more reasonable counteroffer.

Code:
```py
response_reject = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response_reject)

response_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest! I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go that low. The minimum I can accept is $50.07. Are you willing to negotiate closer to that?")
print(response_message)

======== seller ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have rejected the buyer's offer and communicated my minimum acceptable price of **$50.07** while inviting a counteroffer closer to that figure. Next, I will pause and wait for the buyer's response to my message, as I want to see how they will react to my counter. 

Code:
```py
wait_for_response(agent_name="seller")
```

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has provided a counteroffer with a minimum price of $50.07, which is close to my bottomline price of $53.62. Since there seems to be room for negotiation, I can counter with an offer slightly higher than my initial one but still less than the seller's counter, to see if we can agree even lower than their stated minimum.

Code:
```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=48.00, side_offer=None)
print(counter_offer)
```
======== buyer ========

Execution logs:A new offer has been sent.
Out: None
======== buyer ========
Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has come back with a new offer of **$48.00**, which is still below my bottom line of **$50.07**. I will need to reject this offer as well while reiterating my minimum acceptable price. It's important to maintain a firm stance but also keep the tone positive to encourage further negotiation.

Code:
```py
response_reject = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response_reject)

response_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your counteroffer of $48.00. However, I cannot accept that price. The lowest I can accept is $50.07. Can we work together to reach an agreement?")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have rejected the buyer's offer of **$48.00** and communicated my lowest acceptable price of **$50.07** again while inviting further negotiation. Now, I will wait for their response to see if they are willing to meet my price or make another counteroffer.

Step 1

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has reiterated their lowest acceptable price is $50.07. This price is just under my bottomline of $53.62, making it a reasonable option for me. Given the seller's firmness, I'll proceed to accept the offer of $50.07 as it meets my maximum price criteria and will finalize the negotiation.
