Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
To initiate the negotiation, I will start by expressing interest in the item and propose an initial offer. My initial offer will be significantly below the listing price but slightly above my bottomline to keep room for negotiation. I will anchor my price by stating a budget constraint, which is a common strategy to set expectations early in the negotiation. 

Let's proceed with that. 

Thought: I will send a message to the seller to express my interest and make an initial offer at a price lower than the listing. I will also indicate a strict budget constraint to support my offer. 

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the MEGA Pokémon Action Figures Building Toys. However, I'm working with a limited budget. Are you open to negotiating the price?")
print(message)

initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=14.50, side_offer=None)
print(initial_offer)

wait_response = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(wait_response)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has shown interest in negotiating, which is a positive sign. However, their initial offer of 14.5 is significantly below my bottom line price of 18.29. I need to respond to their offer firmly but professionally, clearly indicating that it is too low for me. I will reject the offer and emphasize my willingness to negotiate within a more reasonable range that reflects the item's value. 

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

# I will then send a message to the buyer to propose a starting point closer to my asking price.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller countered with a price of 28.99, which is significantly above my bottom line. I need to work towards a price that is closer to my target, without revealing my bottom line. To do this, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than my previous offer and mention my strict budget constraints. This will keep the negotiation open and show that I'm willing to make a compromise.

Thought: I will make a counteroffer, slightly higher than my previous one, to show willingness to negotiate. I'll reinforce the budget constraint to keep pressure on the seller to lower their asking price.

Code:
```py
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=16.00, side_offer=None)

Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to 16.0, which is still below my bottom line price of 18.29. While it shows they are willing to negotiate, I need to firmly communicate that this is still too low. I will reject this offer and express my willingness to negotiate further, suggesting a price closer to my previous counteroffer while making it clear that I cannot go as low as their current offer.

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

I'll indicate that I'm getting close to my maximum limit to signal that further concessions from the seller are necessary.

Thought: I'll propose a new counteroffer at 17.00, suggesting I'm nearing my maximum, and continue to emphasize my budget constraints to negotiate a more favorable price.

I will reinforce my budget constraint for a final push, aiming to get as close to my acceptable range as possible. 

Thought: I'll attempt another small increase in my offer to 17.36, which is my bottom line, and clearly communicate that it is my absolute maximum due to strict budget constraints. This should convey that it's a final offer.
