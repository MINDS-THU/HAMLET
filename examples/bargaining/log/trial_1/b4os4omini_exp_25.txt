Let's start the negotiation process with a strong initial offer and introduce ourselves. I will send a message to the seller expressing interest in the product, and I will make an initial offer slightly below the listing price to anchor the negotiation. 

Given the listing price is $239.99, I will begin with an offer at a significantly lower price to provide room for counteroffers and adjustments.

Understood. I will now proceed to initiate the negotiation with the seller by sending a message to express interest and making an initial offer. 

To start the negotiation, I'll make an offer significantly below the listing price to create room for negotiation, but not below the bottomline to ensure I have room to adjust the offer later on.

Let's set an initial offer at $80 as a strong starting position.

```py
# Sending a message to the seller and making an initial offer.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in this Ninja SS401 Foodi Power Blender. Are you open to negotiation?")
