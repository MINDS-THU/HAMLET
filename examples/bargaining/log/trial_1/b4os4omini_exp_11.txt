Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start the negotiation process by communicating my interest in the coffee machine and indicating that I'm open to discussion about the pricing. An initial offer significantly below the listing price will help set the anchor for our negotiation.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating the price of the Nespresso VertuoPlus and has made an initial offer of $60, which is significantly lower than my listing price of $169.95 and below my acceptable bottom line of $97.25. I need to respond to their offer in a way that still allows for further negotiation without accepting such a low price. I will reject the offer and send a message indicating that the price is negotiable, but I have to start above their offer.

Code:
```py
response_reject = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response_reject)

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest! However, I cannot accept your offer of $60. The lowest I can go is $97.25. Would you be able to come closer to that price?")
