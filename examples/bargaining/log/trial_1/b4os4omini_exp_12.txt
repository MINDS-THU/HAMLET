======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start the negotiation by expressing interest in purchasing the Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and making an initial offer significantly below the listing price of 349.99, yet not too low to be dismissive. This will give us room to negotiate and potentially settle closer to my target price. I will offer 120 as an initial starting point to open the negotiation.  

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I am interested in purchasing the Nintendo Switch – OLED Model. Are you open to negotiation on the price?")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=120, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest and proposed an offer of $120, which is significantly below my initial asking price of $349.99. This offer is unacceptable as it falls below my bottomline price of $170.06. I need to respond firmly by rejecting this offer while also reinforcing my willingness to negotiate; I should emphasize the value of the product to justify the asking price.

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="I appreciate your interest in the Nintendo Switch – OLED Model. However, the offered price of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price. I can consider offers above $170.06 and I'm open to negotiation.")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The initial response has been sent, rejecting the buyer's offer and communicating my willingness to negotiate as long as the offers are above my bottomline price. Now, I should wait for a response from the buyer before deciding on my next move.

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has provided a counteroffer by stating that they are open to considering offers above $170.06. This gives us a new range to work within. I will make a new offer slightly above their minimum threshold to express willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below my bottomline. I will offer $175, which shows flexibility and may lead to a favorable middle ground.  

Code:
```py
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=175, side_offer=None)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has increased their offer to $175, which is just above my bottomline price of $170.06. While this offer is acceptable, it is still significantly lower than my listing price. I can accept this offer, but it is essential to let the buyer know that it's close to my limit. This strategy can also help me to signal firmness for future negotiations.

response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=True)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have accepted the buyer's offer of $175. This completes the negotiation process successfully, as I secured a deal above my bottomline price. I should now confirm the details of the sale to ensure everything is clear and professional.

Code:
