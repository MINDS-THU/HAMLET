Output message of the LLM:
To initiate the negotiation as a buyer, I'll start with a message to the seller expressing interest in the product and then make an initial offer that's significantly lower than the listing price but still reasonable to allow room for negotiation.

Let's proceed with this strategy.

Thought: I'll send a message to the seller indicating my interest in the product and make an initial low offer to begin the negotiation process.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in buying the BOSCH RA1181 Benchtop Router Table. Are you open to discussing the price?")
print(message)

offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=100, side_offer=None)
print(offer)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest and is open to discussing the price, which is a good starting point for negotiation. However, their initial offer of $100 is significantly below my bottom line price of $139.1. I will explicitly reject this offer to avoid seriously undervaluing the router table and to signal that I am not willing to accept such a low price. After rejecting the offer, I will respond with my initial asking price of $249 to anchor the negotiation. 

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)  # Rejecting the $100 offer

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has rejected my initial offer of $100 and is standing firm on their initial listing price of $249. Since this is significantly higher than my bottomline price of $117.25, I'll need to make a counteroffer closer to my limit but still below it to encourage negotiation.

Thought: I'll make a counteroffer at a slightly higher price to show willingness to negotiate while still being below the seller’s price.
