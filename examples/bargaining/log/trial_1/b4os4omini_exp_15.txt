Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will initiate the negotiation by expressing my interest in buying the Philips Hue smart bulb and make an initial offer. I will begin with an offer significantly below the listing price, but above my bottomline, to have room for adjustments. I'll also express urgency to encourage a more favorable response.

Code:

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has shown interest in the product but has started with an unacceptably low offer of $20, which is significantly below my bottom line of $27.76. I need to reject this offer immediately to signal that I am serious about the pricing while also keeping the lines of communication open for future negotiation. I'll also send a message to acknowledge their interest and reiterate my willingness to negotiate within a reasonable price range.

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your interest in the Philips Hue smart bulb! I'm open to negotiation, but I can't accept an offer that low. My asking price is $54.99, but I'm willing to discuss a more reasonable price.")
