Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! Let's start the negotiation by expressing interest and making a low initial offer to have room to adjust our position. I'll send a message to indicate my interest in the Spider-Man UHD/BD Combo + Digital and make an offer below the listing price.

Thought: I'll send a message to express interest in the item and make an initial offer of $10 to start the negotiation.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in purchasing the Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse UHD/BD Combo + Digital. Are you open to negotiating the price?")

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating and has made an initial offer of $10, which is well below my bottomline price of $13.16. I need to respond quickly to reject this offer while maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation going. I will counter with a price that is still below my listing price to allow for further negotiation while asserting that I cannot accept such a low bid.

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has rejected my initial offer and countered with a price of $25. This is still above my maximum limit, so I'll need to make a counteroffer while staying within my budget constraints.

Thought: I'll counter the seller's offer with a price closer to my bottomline, say $12, to move closer to a mutually agreeable price while leaving room for further adjustments.
