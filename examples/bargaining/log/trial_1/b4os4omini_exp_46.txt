Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! Let's begin the negotiation process.

Thought: I will start by approaching the seller with an interest in the item and make an initial offer starting significantly below their listing price to begin the bargaining conversation. I want to leave enough room for adjustments upwards but not exceed the bottomline price.

Code:
```py
# Initial approach message to the seller expressing interest
initial_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the Shark NV356E Navigator Lift-Away Vacuum. Would you be open to negotiating the price?")
print(initial_message)

# Make an initial offer below the listing price
initial_offer_price = 75.00  # Starting significantly lower since our bottomline is 84.54

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating the price, which is a positive sign. However, their offered price of $75.00 is significantly below my bottom line of $110.33. I need to respond by firmly rejecting their offer while reiterating the value of the vacuum and indicating my willingness to negotiate further.
