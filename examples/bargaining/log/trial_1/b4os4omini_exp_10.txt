Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
**Thought:**  
The seller is open to discussing the price and is highlighting the product's value. I will make an initial offer that is significantly below the listing price but still reasonable. This will keep room for negotiation while showing seriousness in my interest. I will offer $30.00 to start the negotiation process.

**Code:**  
```py
initial_offer_price = 30.00
offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=initial_offer_price, side_offer=None)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has proposed an initial offer of $30.00. This is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $30.87, so I need to reject their offer. I'll respond courteously but firmly to maintain a good rapport while making it clear that the offer is too low.

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I've rejected the buyer's initial offer of $30.00. Now, I'll send a message to explain that while I'm flexible, I cannot go that low. I will suggest a more reasonable counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving forward and encourage the buyer to consider a higher price.

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your offer, but unfortunately, I can't accept $30.00. The lowest I can go for the Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor is $30.87. Would you be willing to consider this price?")
