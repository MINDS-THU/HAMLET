Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will start the negotiation by expressing interest in the item and make an initial offer that's lower than my maximum price to leave room for further negotiation. Since the listing price is $25.99, I will begin with an initial offer of $10.00 to anchor our negotiating position favorably.

Code:
```py
# Send a message to express interest and make an initial offer
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the Interstellar (4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital). I'm hoping we can negotiate to find a price that works for both of us.")
print(message)

# Make an initial offer

Step 2

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: Now that I've sent an initial message and offer, I should wait for the seller to respond. This will allow me to gauge their reaction and adjust my negotiation strategy accordingly.

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating the price for the Interstellar item, which is a good starting point for the conversation. However, their proposed offer of $10.00 is significantly below my bottom line price of $13.55, which I cannot accept. I will first respond to the buyer's offer to reject it politely and then create a counteroffer that is closer to my listing price, encouraging further negotiation.

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response)

counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=24.99)

Step 2
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I've rejected the buyer's initial offer and made a counteroffer of $24.99, which is still below my listing price but allows room for negotiation. Since I am waiting for the buyer's response to my counteroffer, I will pause to give them time to consider it before taking further actions.

======== buyer ========
Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has reduced their offer slightly to $24.99 from the original listing price of $25.99. This indicates they might be willing to negotiate further. I will counter by increasing my offer slightly to $11.50 to show willingness to compromise, while still leaving room to negotiate within my budget.

Code:
```py
# Make a counteroffer to continue negotiations
counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=11.50, side_offer=None)

Output message of the LLM:

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has made a new offer of $11.50, which is still below my bottom line price of $13.55. I will need to reject this offer as well, but I want to continue negotiating. To keep the conversation active, I will propose a counteroffer that reflects my bottom line and leaves room for negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has come down significantly to $13.55, which is close to my maximum limit of $13.99. This is a favorable outcome, and I'm nearly at the point where I can accept. I will make a small counteroffer to $13.75 to see if I can get a slightly better deal, while ensuring I'm still within my acceptable price range.
