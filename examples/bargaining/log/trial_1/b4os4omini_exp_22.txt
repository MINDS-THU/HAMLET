Output message of the LLM:
Thought: To start the negotiation process, I'll send a message to the seller expressing my interest in the item and my willingness to negotiate. Then, I'll make an initial offer significantly below the listing price to leave room for further negotiation.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer is interested in the Beats Studio Pro headphones but has made an initial offer significantly below my listing price of $349.99. It's important to quickly reject their offer of $100 and counter with a price that still leaves room for negotiation. I will propose an initial counteroffer that still reflects the value of the item while being lower than the listing price to show flexibility. I will counter with a price of $299.99, which is a reasonable reduction but still above my bottom line.  

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)  # Rejecting the buyer's offer of 100
