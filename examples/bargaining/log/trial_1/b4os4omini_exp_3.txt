Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has expressed interest in negotiating the price of "The Exorcist 50th Anniversary Edition" and has made a very low initial offer of $10.00, which is significantly below my bottomline price of $16.52. I will quickly reject this offer to communicate that the price is too low and then counter with an initial offer that is more aligned with my asking price of $29.99. I will aim to maintain some negotiating space for further discussions.
