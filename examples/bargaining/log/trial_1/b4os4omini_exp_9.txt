======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
To start the negotiation, I'll reach out to the seller to express interest in this item. Then, I'll present an initial offer that is significantly below the listing price but above my bottomline price, leaving room for adjustment. This will be a strong initial position to negotiate from.

Let's get started.

Thought: I will send a message to the seller to express interest in the item and make an initial offer of $40 to anchor the negotiation. This initial offer is substantially below the listing price and gives room for negotiation without nearing my bottomline price.

Code:
```py
# Sending a message to the seller to express interest
interest_message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I am interested in purchasing the Summer Infant Extra Tall & Wide Safety Pet and Baby Gate. Would you be open to discussing the price?")

# Making an initial offer to the seller
initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=40, side_offer=None)

# Print outputs to observe the agent's messages and offer
print(interest_message)

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have sent a message expressing interest and made an initial offer of $40 to the seller. Now, I will wait for the seller's response to my offer or message. This will give some room for negotiation while maintaining flexibility.

Code:
```py

# Print the seller's response to determine the next steps

I need to reject this low offer firmly but professionally and invite them to put forward a more reasonable proposal. I'll also provide a message indicating that I'm willing to negotiate and emphasize the value of the gate. 

Code:
```py
