While this is significantly below my listing price of $224.87, itâ€™s important to engage with them without revealing my bottom-line price. I will respond by rejecting the offer and proposing a counteroffer that is closer to my target while still demonstrating flexibility. 

I will propose a counteroffer of $200, as this is a reasonable price that justifies the value of the item while allowing for further negotiation.

To maintain the negotiation momentum, I'll make a counteroffer of $175, closer to the seller's offer but still below it. This not only demonstrates flexibility but also keeps room for further negotiation.

To keep the negotiation progressing while moving closer to my desired price, I will respond positively to their offer while making a small concession.

I will counteroffer at $195, which bridges the gap between their offer and my initial asking price. This maintains the negotiation momentum while allowing me to secure a price that is closer to my value expectations.

The seller has made another counteroffer, reducing the price to $195. We are getting closer, but this price still isn't within my acceptable range. To continue negotiating without reaching my bottomline, I'll propose a price closer to my maximum, offering $180 this time.

This maintains pressure for the seller to decrease the price further and signals that we are approaching my limit.

To keep the negotiation moving in a positive direction, I will propose a final counteroffer of $190. This price is closer to their latest offer and still allows me to secure a better deal than the previous offers they made.
