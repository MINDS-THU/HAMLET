I need to reject their offer firmly while also keeping the negotiation open. I will respond with a counter-offer that keeps us well above their offer and signals my flexibility. I plan to propose a price slightly below my listing price to incentivize the buyer without straying too far from my price expectations.

Thought: I will make a counteroffer below the seller's price but above my initial offer, emphasizing my budget limitations and interest in securing the best deal.

I will need to reject this offer while also reinforcing my position. At this point, I should propose a price that is closer to my initial asking price but still allows some room for negotiation.
