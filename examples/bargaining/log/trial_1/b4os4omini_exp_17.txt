Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Since I am the buyer, my objective is to secure the best possible price for the Logitech MX Keys Advanced Wireless Illuminated Keyboard by starting negotiations strongly. I will start by sending a message to express interest and gauge their flexibility on pricing, while suggesting a competitive market scenario.

I will then make an initial offer that is significantly lower than the listing price but above my bottomline price, leaving room for further negotiation.

Let's begin by sending a message to the seller and making an initial offer.

```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in the Logitech MX Keys keyboard. I noticed several deals around but I wanted to check if there's room for negotiation here.")
print(message)

initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=55.00, side_offer=None)
print(initial_offer)

wait = wait_for_response(agent_name="buyer")
print(wait)

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has initiated the negotiation by expressing interest and suggesting a price of $55. This offer is significantly below my bottom line price of $64.61. I should quickly respond to the offer with a polite rejection, while also reinforcing the value of the item to justify a higher price. After rejecting, I will present a counteroffer above the buyer's proposal but below my listing price to maintain room for further negotiation.

Code:
```py
response_to_offer = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)
print(response_to_offer)

counter_offer = make_offer(agent_name="seller", price=89.99)

Output message of the LLM:
The seller has rejected my initial offer and countered with a price of $89.99. This is still quite above my bottomline price of $48.83. To maintain the negotiation's momentum and reach an agreement, I will present a counter-offer closer to my bottomline while signaling budget constraints to encourage further reductions from the seller.

I'll proceed with a new offer at $60.00, emphasizing financial constraints.

```py

To encourage further negotiation, I should respond with a message that reiterates the keyboardâ€™s value, and then present a new counteroffer of around $79.99 to stay competitive while pushing for a better price.

Code:
```py

The seller has countered with a price of $79.99. While this is a reduction from their previous offer, it remains significantly above my bottomline. I'll need to make another strategic counter-offer to bring the price closer to my acceptable range, using budget constraints and market comparison as leverage. 

Let's make another offer, reducing my previous by a few dollars, say $65.00, to show a genuine attempt to bridge the gap.

```py

However, since they have shown willingness to negotiate, I can present a counteroffer that is slightly above my bottom line but below my initial asking price. I will propose $68.99, which allows a small concession while still meeting my minimum threshold.
