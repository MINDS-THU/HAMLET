======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I will initiate the negotiation with a message expressing my interest in the product. It's important to establish a positive and open tone right from the start, which will help set the stage for the price discussions. I will then make an initial offer that's significantly below the listing price to anchor the negotiation within a range that favors the buyer.

Code:
```py
# Sending an initial message to express interest in the product.
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="Hello! I'm interested in purchasing the Sargent Art 120 Piece Assortment Colored Pencils. Are you open to negotiating the price?")

Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has shown interest in the colored pencils and is open to negotiation. I will respond positively to their message, confirming my willingness to negotiate while also providing some value about the product to engage them further. This sets the stage for discussing the price in the next step.
