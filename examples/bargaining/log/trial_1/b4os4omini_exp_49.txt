Output message of the LLM:
Sure, I'll begin the negotiation by expressing interest in the item and making an initial offer below the listing price to create room for adjustments. This approach respects the guidelines to start strong while allowing flexibility for further negotiation.

Let's start with an initial offer of $15.00, which is below our bottomline price of $17.46, to leave room for necessary adjustments.

I'll also send a message to show my interest in the item.

Let's proceed.
