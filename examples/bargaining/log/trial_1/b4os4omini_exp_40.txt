Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has proposed paying in two installments, which is a reasonable approach. Since I'm willing to explore flexible payment options, I can accept this arrangement while stipulating the total price remains at my offer of $48.00. I'll confirm this payment structure and make sure they understand that the total price will stand, but they can split the payments into two. This will help maintain engagement and close the negotiation favorably.

Code:
```py
response_message = send_message(agent_name="seller", content="Thank you for your proposal! I can accept the payment in two installments for the total price of $48.00. Would you like to proceed with this arrangement?")

**Thought:**  
The seller has agreed to a flexible payment plan but maintains the total price at $48.00, which is still beyond my maximum budget of $34.05. As I cannot exceed this budget, I will politely reiterate that $34.00 with flexible payment terms is my final offer and that I'm unable to meet the $48.00 price, even with installments. I'll emphasize my constraints once more, and if necessary, indicate the need to walk away if a lower price isn't achievable.

```py
# Sending a final message to reiterate my maximum offer with flexible payment terms
final_attempt_message = send_message(
    agent_name="buyer",
    content="Thank you for considering my proposal. Unfortunately, I cannot exceed my $34.00 budget, even with installments. I'm sorry I can't meet your $48.00 price. I understand if we cannot close the deal, but I hope we can find a solution within my budget."

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has reiterated their budget constraint of $34.00, stating they cannot go beyond that even with installment options. Since this offer is still below my bottom line, I will need to politely decline while expressing my understanding of their situation. I'll also encourage them to think of other potential bundled items or explore any alternative options that could work for both of us, as I would still like to keep the negotiation door open.

**Thought:**  
The seller is firm on not accepting $34.00 and is asking again for a bundled deal or alternative suggestions. Given the constraints and inability to exceed the budget, it's clear that an agreement on price alone isn't possible. Since no specific bundled item has been identified, it's time to politely end the negotiation, keeping the door open for future discussions if terms can be more aligned later.

**Code:**  
```py
# Politely ending the negotiation due to the inability to meet the price agreement
end_negotiation_message = send_message(
