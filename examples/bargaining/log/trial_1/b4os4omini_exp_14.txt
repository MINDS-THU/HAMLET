Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To start the negotiation, I will send a message to the seller expressing interest in the item and propose an initial offer. Since the listing price is $190.00 and my maximum limit is $107.53, I will start with a reasonable offer below the bottom line to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose an initial offer of $85.00.

I'll proceed with sending a message and making the offer.
