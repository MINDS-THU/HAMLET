Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Certainly! To start the negotiation as the buyer, I will send a message to the seller expressing interest in the item and make an initial offer below the listing price to open the negotiation.  

Thought: I will send a message expressing interest in the product and make an initial offer significantly lower than the listing price but within a reasonable range to leave room for negotiation. This will help test the flexibility of the seller's pricing.  

Code:
```py
message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I am interested in purchasing the NOCO Boost HD GB70. Can we negotiate the price?")
print(message)

initial_offer = make_offer(agent_name="buyer", price=90, side_offer=None)
print(initial_offer)

Step 2

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: I have successfully sent a message expressing interest in the product, along with an initial offer of $90. Now, I will wait for the seller's response to my message and offer to see if they are open to negotiation and how they react to my initial price point.

======== seller ========
Step 1
======== seller ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has shown interest in negotiating for the NOCO Boost HD GB70 and has proposed a price of $90. Since this price is significantly below my bottomline price of $98.95, I need to reject this offer firmly but professionally. After that, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my listing price to signal that I am open to negotiation while still aiming for a price that benefits me. I will propose a new offer at $150 as my starting point. 

Code:
```py
response = respond_to_offer(agent_name="seller", response=False)

Output message of the LLM:

Step 1
======== buyer ========
Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has rejected my initial offer of $90 and countered with a price of $150. I will make a counteroffer closer to my maximum acceptable price while keeping room for further negotiation. This will show that I'm willing to increase my offer, but still aim to get the best deal possible.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The buyer has countered with a new offer of $110, which is still below my bottomline price of $98.95. While this is an improvement over their last offer, I will need to respond with a counteroffer that is still higher than their new offer to bring the negotiation closer to my acceptable range. I will counter with an offer of $145 to keep the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a suitable price for myself.

Output message of the LLM:
Thought: The seller has reduced their offer to $145. While this shows some movement, it's still above my target price. I'll make another counteroffer to show I'm willing to meet in the middle but remain firm in staying below or near my maximum acceptable price.
