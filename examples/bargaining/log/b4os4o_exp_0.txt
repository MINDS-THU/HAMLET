To kick off the negotiation, I'll start with sending a message indicating my interest and making an initial offer slightly below the listing price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed. Let's aim for a strategic start.

I'll proceed with these steps:
- Send a message to express interest in the smart lock.
- Make an initial offer that is below the listing price but provides room for negotiation.

Let's correct that and properly format the code for initiating the negotiation.

Thought: I'm going to express interest in the smart lock and make an initial offer to open the negotiation, targeting a starting position lower than the listing price but ensuring it is reasonable enough to engage the seller.

message = send_message(agent_name="buyer", content="I'm interested in the Level Lock+ Smart Lock. Would you be open to negotiating the price?")
print(message)

2. Additionally, I'll mention budget constraints to convey that I cannot go much higher.
