Instructions:
- Implement a function called run_simulation() that performs the simulation for the bidding process.
- The simulation should run 10,000 iterations for each candidate bid amount from 10,500 to 15,000 (in increments of 500).
- For each candidate bid, compute summary statistics (such as mean and standard deviation) for both the win indicator and profit.
- Your function should return a dictionary where the keys follow the format:
    'wins for bidding 10500': np.array([...]), # 10,000 simulated values
    'profit for bidding 10500': np.array([...]) # 10,000 simulated values
