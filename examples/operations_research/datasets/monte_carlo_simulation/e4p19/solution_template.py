Solution Template

Implement a function called run_simulation() that simulates the cash flows over a ten-year period and estimates two outputs:
- The net present value (NPV) of after-tax cash flows.
- The number of years in which sales occur.

Example output:
{'npv': np.array([...]), # 10,000 simulated values
 'years of sales': np.array([...]) # 10,000 simulated values}
