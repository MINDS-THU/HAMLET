Solution Template

Implement a function called run_simulation() that simulates the pricing of an Asian option as described.
Simulate for 10000 iterations.
Your function should return a dictionary with the following structure:

Example:
{'asian option value': np.array([...]) # 10,000 simulated values}

def run_simulation():
    # Your simulation implementation goes here.
    results = {}
    return results
