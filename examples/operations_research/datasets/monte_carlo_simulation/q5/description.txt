A TSB (Tax Saver Benefit plan) allows you to put money into an account at the beginning of the calendar year that may be used for medical expenses. This amount is not subject to federal tax (hence the phrase TSB). As you pay medical expenses during the year, you are reimbursed by the administrator of the TSB until the TSB account is exhausted. From that point on, you must pay your medical expenses out of your own pocket. On the other hand, if you put more money into your TSB than the medical expenses you incur, this extra money is lost to you. Your annual salary is $50,000 and your federal income tax rate is 30%.

a. Assume that your medical expenses in a year are normally distributed with mean $2000 and standard deviation $500. Build a model in which the output is the amount of money left to you after paying taxes, putting money in a TSB, and paying any extra medical expenses. 
Experiment with different TSB contributions, ranging from $1,000 to $3,000 in increments of $250.
