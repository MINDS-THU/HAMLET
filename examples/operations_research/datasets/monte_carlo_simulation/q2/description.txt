You are the manager of Tex Electronics and are planning a promotion on a discontinued model of 27" color TVs. The promotion will last 10 days, at the end of which any sets that you ordered but have not sold will be sold to another retailer for $250 each. You must order the sets from the manufacturer before you know what the demand during the promotion will be. Your cost is $350 per set and you will sell them for $600. You estimate that each day there is a 50% chance of no one wanting to buy a set, a 30% chance of 1 person wanting to buy a set, and a 20% chance of 2 people wanting to buy a set. Assume that the demand on one day is independent from the demand on other days.
