Instructions:
- Implement a function called run_simulation() that simulates the warranty process as described in the problem.
- The simulation should run 10,000 iterations.
- Your simulation should estimate the relevant performance measures.
- The function should return a dictionary with the following structure:

    {
        "failures": np.array([...]), # 10,000 simulated values
        "npv profit": np.array([...]), # 10,000 simulated values
    }

def run_simulation():
    # Your simulation implementation goes here.
    results = {}
    return results
