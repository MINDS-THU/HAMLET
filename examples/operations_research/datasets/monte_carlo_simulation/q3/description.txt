Mockingbird Airline has a small commuter airplane with places for 16 passengers. The airline uses this jet on a route for which it charges $225 for a one-way fare. Every flight has a fixed cost of $900 (for pilot's salary, fuel, airport fees, and so on). Each passenger costs Mockingbird an additional $100. Refunds for for unused tickets are made only if the reservation is cancelled at least 24 hours before scheduled departure.

The CEO of Mockingbird is wondering whether the company should "overbook" the airplane on this route. Overbooking means selling more seats than are available, on the grounds that sometimes passengers holding confirmed seats do not show up. The no-show rate for the route in question is 4%. That is, on average approximately 4% of those passengers holding confirmed reservations do not show up. If Mockingbird does overbook and more passengers arrive to claim their reservations than there are seats available, the airline must "bump" some of the passengers. The airline would do this by asking for volunteers. If a passenger with a reserved seat is willing to give up his or her seat, the airline would give a refund as well as provide a free ticket to the same or similar destination.
