Suppose you buy an electronic device that you operate continuously. The device costs you $100 and carries a one-year warranty. The warranty states that if the device fails during its first year of use, you get a new device for no cost, and this new device carries exactly the same warranty. However, if the device fails after the first year of use, the warranty is of no value. You need this device for the next six years. Therefore, any time the device fails outside its warranty period, you must pay $100 for another device of the same kind. (We'll assume the price doesn't increase during the six-year peiod.) The time until failure of the device is gamma distributed with parameters alpha = 2 and beta = 0.5. (This implies a mean of one year.) 
Simulate the six-year period. Include as outputs (1) your total cost, (2) the number of failures during the warranty period, and (3) the number of devices owned during the six-year period.
