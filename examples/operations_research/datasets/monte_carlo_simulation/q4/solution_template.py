Solution Template

Implement a function called run_simulation() that simulates a six-year period of operating an electronic device,
including replacement under warranty and out-of-warranty failures.
Simulate for 10000 iterations.
Your function should return a dictionary with the following structure:

Example:
{
    'total cost': np.array([...]), # 10,000 simulated values
    'num of failures during warranty': np.array([...]), # 10,000 simulated values
    'devices owned': np.array([...]) # 10,000 simulated values
}

    # Your simulation implementation goes here.
    results = {}
    return results
