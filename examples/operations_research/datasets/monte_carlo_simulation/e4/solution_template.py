Solution Template

Implement a function called run_simulation() that simulates the cash flows and computes the NPV of after-tax cash flows.
The simulation should run 10,000 iterations.
Your function should return a dictionary with the following structure:

Example:
{'npv': np.array([...]), # 10,000 simulated values}

    # Your simulation implementation goes here.
    results = {}
