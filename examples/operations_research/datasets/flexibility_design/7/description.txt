Dairy Products Supplier to Different Food Industries

I manage a dairy supply business that produces two key products: milk powder and cheese blocks. These products are supplied to three types of food industry clients: confectionery producers, bakeries, and restaurant chains. Our production capacities are 500 units for milk powder and 400 units for cheese blocks. The profitability per unit varies based on the product and the client type. Milk powder yields $8 per unit to confectionery producers, $7 to bakeries, and $9 to restaurant chains. Cheese blocks are more profitable, bringing in $6 per unit to confectionery producers, $10 to bakeries, and $11 to restaurant chains. However, we can only establish two distribution connections between our dairy products and these food industry clients. The demand from each client type is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: confectionery producers expect an average demand of 125 units with a standard deviation of 25, bakeries anticipate 100 units with a standard deviation of 20, and restaurant chains foresee 225 units with a standard deviation of 30. I need assistance in selecting which dairy products should be supplied to which food industry clients to maximize our expected profitability under these constraints and demand uncertainties.
