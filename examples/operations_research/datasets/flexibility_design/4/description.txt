Furniture Factory and Various Customer Segments

I run a furniture manufacturing business that produces three types of wooden furniture: dining tables, office desks, and coffee tables. These products are sold to three distinct customer segments: local furniture stores, corporate offices, and online home décor sites. Our production capacities are 150 units for dining tables, 120 units for office desks, and 180 units for coffee tables. The profitability per unit varies depending on the product and the customer segment. Dining tables generate $20 per unit when sold to local furniture stores, $25 to corporate offices, and $22 to online décor sites. Office desks are more profitable with $18 per unit for local stores, $30 for corporate offices, and $16 for online platforms. Coffee tables yield $10 per unit to local stores, $12 to corporate offices, and $15 to online décor sites. However, we are restricted to establishing four distribution connections between our furniture products and customer segments. The demand from each customer segment is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: local furniture stores expect an average demand of 100 units with a standard deviation of 20, corporate offices 80 units with a standard deviation of 15, and online décor sites anticipate 150 units with a standard deviation of 30. I need help determining the optimal product-to-customer connections to maximize our expected profits given these capacity constraints and demand uncertainties.
