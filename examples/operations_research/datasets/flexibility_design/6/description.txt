Printed Book Manufacturer Serving Bookstores and E-tailers

I operate a printing business that produces three categories of books: fiction, non-fiction, and children’s books. These books are sold through two main channels: brick-and-mortar bookstores and online platforms. Our production capacities are 1,000 units for fiction books, 800 units for non-fiction books, and 600 units for children’s books. The profitability per unit depends on both the book category and the sales channel. Fiction books yield $5 per unit in bookstores and $7 per unit online. Non-fiction books generate $6 per unit in bookstores and $6 per unit online, making them equally profitable across both channels. Children’s books bring in $4 per unit in bookstores but $8 per unit online. However, we are limited to establishing three distribution connections between our book categories and the sales channels. The demand from each sales channel is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: bookstores expect an average demand of 900 units with a standard deviation of 100, while online platforms anticipate 600 units with a standard deviation of 80. I need help deciding which book categories should be sold through which sales channels to maximize our expected profits while considering these production capacities and demand uncertainties.
