Fashion Apparel Production and Retailers

I operate a clothing factory that produces two types of jackets: men’s jackets and women’s jackets. These jackets are sold through three different retail channels: department stores, online platforms, and discount outlets. Our production capacities are 200 units for men’s jackets and 300 units for women’s jackets. The profitability varies based on the jacket type and the retail channel. Men’s jackets yield a profit of $15 per unit in department stores, $14 in online platforms, and $10 in discount outlets. On the other hand, women’s jackets bring in $12 per unit in department stores, $15 in online platforms, and $9 in discount outlets. However, we can only establish three sales connections between our jacket types and the retail channels. The demand from each retail channel is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: department stores anticipate an average demand of 150 units with a standard deviation of 25, online platforms expect 120 units with a standard deviation of 20, and discount outlets foresee 75 units with a standard deviation of 15. I need assistance in deciding which jacket types should be sold through which retail channels to maximize our expected profits while managing these uncertainties.
