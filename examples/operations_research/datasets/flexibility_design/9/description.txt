Textile Mill Providing Fabrics to Clothing Companies

I manage a textile mill that produces two types of fabric rolls: cotton fabric and polyester fabric. These fabrics are supplied to two categories of clothing companies: sportswear companies and casual wear companies. Our production capacities are 1,000 units for cotton fabric and 1,200 units for polyester fabric. The profitability per unit varies based on the fabric type and the clothing company category. Cotton fabric yields $3 per unit to sportswear companies and $4 per unit to casual wear companies. Polyester fabric is more profitable in sportswear companies, bringing in $5 per unit, but yields $3 per unit to casual wear companies. However, we can only establish two distribution connections between our fabrics and these clothing company categories. The demand from each clothing company category is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: sportswear companies expect an average demand of 600 units with a standard deviation of 100, while casual wear companies anticipate 500 units with a standard deviation of 80. I seek assistance in deciding how to allocate our cotton and polyester fabrics to these clothing company categories to maximize our expected profits under these production capacities and demand uncertainties.
