Metal Component Manufacturer and Automotive Segments

I run a metal component manufacturing business that produces three types of metal parts: steel rods, aluminum plates, and copper wiring. These components are supplied to four different automotive segments: car manufacturers, truck manufacturers, motorcycle makers, and spare parts distributors. Our production capacities are 600 units for steel rods, 400 units for aluminum plates, and 300 units for copper wiring. The profitability per unit varies based on the metal component and the automotive segment. Steel rods yield $15 per unit to car manufacturers, $14 to truck manufacturers, $12 to motorcycle makers, and $10 to spare parts distributors. Aluminum plates are more profitable, bringing in $20 per unit to car manufacturers, $18 to truck manufacturers, $16 to motorcycle makers, and $15 to spare parts distributors. Copper wiring generates $10 per unit to car manufacturers, $12 to truck manufacturers, $8 to motorcycle makers, and $9 to spare parts distributors. However, we are limited to establishing five distribution connections between our metal components and these automotive segments. The demand from each segment is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: car manufacturers expect an average demand of 300 units with a standard deviation of 50, truck manufacturers 200 units with a standard deviation of 40, motorcycle makers anticipate 250 units with a standard deviation of 60, and spare parts distributors foresee 150 units with a standard deviation of 30. I need help determining the optimal connections between our metal components and automotive segments to maximize our expected profits given these production capacities and demand uncertainties.
