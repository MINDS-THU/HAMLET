Agricultural Supply to Retail Stores

I oversee a small agricultural cooperative that cultivates three types of crops: wheat, corn, and soy. We aim to distribute these crops to four distinct types of retail stores, namely local groceries, large supermarket chains, organic specialty shops, and online vendors. Our storage and processing capacities are limited to 500 units of wheat, 300 units of corn, and 400 units of soy. The profitability varies depending on the crop and the store type: selling wheat yields a profit of $2 per unit to local groceries, $3 to large supermarkets, $4 to organic specialty shops, and $5 to online vendors. Corn brings in $1 per unit to local groceries, $2 to large supermarkets, and $3 each to organic specialty shops and online vendors. Soy is more profitable with $2 per unit to local groceries, $1 to large supermarkets, $5 to organic specialty shops, and $4 to online vendors. However, we can only establish up to five distribution connections between our crops and these store types. Additionally, the demand from each store type is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: local groceries expect an average demand of 250 units with a standard deviation of 50 units, large supermarkets 150 units with a standard deviation of 30, organic specialty shops 75 units with a standard deviation of 15, and online vendors 125 units with a standard deviation of 25. I need help deciding which crop should be linked to which store types to maximize our expected profits under these constraints and uncertainties.
