Electronics Manufacturer Serving Different Markets

I manage a small electronics manufacturing facility that produces three key components: Microchip A, Microchip B, and Battery Packs. We supply these components to three categories of gadgets: smartphones, tablets, and smartwatches. Our production capacities are 1,000 units for Microchip A, 800 units for Microchip B, and 600 units for Battery Packs. The profit margins differ based on the component and the gadget it serves. Specifically, selling Microchip A to smartphones yields $10 per unit, to tablets $8, and to smartwatches $5. Microchip B brings in $6 per unit for smartphones, $9 for tablets, and $7 for smartwatches. Battery Packs are more straightforward, with profits of $4 per unit for smartphones, $5 for tablets, and $6 for smartwatches. However, we are limited to establishing four distribution connections between our components and gadget categories. The demand for each gadget type is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: smartphones have an average demand of 700 units with a standard deviation of 100, tablets average 300 units with a standard deviation of 50, and smartwatches average 500 units with a standard deviation of 80. I seek guidance on selecting the optimal component-to-gadget links to ensure the highest expected profitability despite these uncertainties.
