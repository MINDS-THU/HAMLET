Chemical Processing Plant and Industrial Clients

I manage a chemical processing plant that produces two essential chemicals: Chemical A and Chemical B. These chemicals are supplied to four different industrial clients: pharmaceutical firms, agricultural companies, plastic manufacturers, and paint producers. Our production capacities are 400 units for Chemical A and 500 units for Chemical B. The profitability varies based on the chemical and the client type. Specifically, Chemical A yields $50 per unit to pharmaceutical firms, $40 to agricultural companies, $45 to plastic manufacturers, and $42 to paint producers. Chemical B brings in $30 per unit for pharmaceutical firms, $35 for agricultural companies, $25 for plastic manufacturers, and $20 for paint producers. However, we can only establish three distribution connections between our chemicals and these industrial clients. The demand from each client type is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: pharmaceutical firms expect an average demand of 150 units with a standard deviation of 25, agricultural companies 250 units with a standard deviation of 40, plastic manufacturers anticipate 115 units with a standard deviation of 20, and paint producers foresee 75 units with a standard deviation of 15. I seek assistance in selecting which chemical should be supplied to which industrial client to maximize our expected profitability under these constraints and demand uncertainties.
