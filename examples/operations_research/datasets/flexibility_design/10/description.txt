Beverage Manufacturer Serving Distributors and Retail Chains

I operate a beverage manufacturing company that produces three types of bottled beverages: sparkling water, iced tea, and fruit juice. These beverages are supplied to two categories of buyers: regional distributors and national retail chains. Our production capacities are 800 units for sparkling water, 500 units for iced tea, and 600 units for fruit juice. The profitability per unit varies based on the beverage type and the buyer category. Sparkling water yields $2 per unit to regional distributors and $4 per unit to national retail chains. Iced tea brings in $3 per unit to regional distributors and $5 per unit to national retail chains. Fruit juice is the most profitable, generating $4 per unit to regional distributors and $6 per unit to national retail chains. However, we are limited to establishing three distribution connections between our beverages and these buyer categories. The demand from each buyer category is uncertain and follows a normal distribution: regional distributors expect an average demand of 600 units with a standard deviation of 80, while national retail chains anticipate 400 units with a standard deviation of 50. I need help determining the optimal connections between our bottled beverages and buyer categories to maximize our expected profits while considering these production capacities and demand uncertainties.
