A once mundane trip to the bathroom can become a spa-like experience with the addition of a WASHLET. The TOTO WASHLET K300 features instantaneous water heating with five spray settings for front and rear washing, including an optional oscillating or pulsating stream. Equipped with a comfortable heated seat, warm air dryer, and a deodorizer to neutralize odors and enhance your overall experience. The illuminated remote control can be handheld or mounted to the wall for convenient use. The K300 prevents toilet bowl waste buildup by using TOTO's advanced PREMIST technology that sprays the bowl before every use to keep it clean. The new K300 model utilizes TOTO's EWATER+ system when the wand self-cleans. EWATER+ uses electrolyzed water generated by a technologically advanced process, transforming the water into a safe and powerful compound. This cleaning technology helps to keep create peace of mind by cleaning the inside and outside of the wand before and after every use. The WASHLET reduces the need for toilet paper, thus conserving trees and water used to manufacture each roll. As we get older, reduced mobility, medical conditions, and debilitating illnesses can make it increasingly hard to clean ourselves after using the toilet. With a WASHLET, just the touch of a button can leave you feeling clean and refreshed.
