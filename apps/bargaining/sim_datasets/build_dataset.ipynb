The truck is in great condition with no mechanical flaws whatsoever and a clean accident history. Got new tires about 3,000 miles ago. Always has the oil changed on time (due in about 1k). Just got a thorough cleaning inside and a wash and wax outside (still wet in the photos). This truck has never been offroad, but the 4WD is working perfectly from the few times we've been up to Tahoe in it. However, it's a 10+ year old truck that's been driven, not babied and garaged all the time. It's got some scratches, paint is not perfect, but zero body damage.\\n\",\n",

Captaining a tandem is very much like riding a loaded touring bike, except the luggage pedals.\\nTry to be steady and predictable. Tandems don't handle like singles; you can't make sudden last second changes in direction or speed.  Stokers can make the problem much worse (without realizing it) by leaning  or attempting to steer. Stokers often lean slightly in an attempt to see around the captain. The stoker should be very quiet (little body movement) on the bike when you first start out until handling is in control and always quiet going downhill. . Stokers need to realize that their movements affect bike balance (steering)  Tandems are more stable at higher speeds than singles.\\n\",\n",

    "        This ensures buyer value is always greater than seller cost, creating a ZOPA.\n",
