Captaining a tandem is very much like riding a loaded touring bike, except the luggage pedals.\nTry to be steady and predictable. Tandems don't handle like singles; you can't make sudden last second changes in direction or speed.  Stokers can make the problem much worse (without realizing it) by leaning  or attempting to steer. Stokers often lean slightly in an attempt to see around the captain. The stoker should be very quiet (little body movement) on the bike when you first start out until handling is in control and always quiet going downhill. . Stokers need to realize that their movements affect bike balance (steering)  Tandems are more stable at higher speeds than singles.\n",

I got a lot of rust off the rims , handle bars, chain guard, front fork piece. Look at the before and after pictures. The only thing un-original is the Schwinn seat. It has a lot of extra parts, brakes well, beautiful logo, frame is numbered, well taken care of, it has it's battle scars. The only thing that night be missing is the air pump that I believe goes on the 2 pins inside the frame. Look at pictures.\nI got this from an estate sale and the story behind this bike is that the original owner boughit it in Holland, circa 1950's, and was daily commuter for him.\nSerious buyers only please.\n",

And that super cool looking Schwinn \"wings\" head badge. Dated 1952 based on serial number.\nVery cool rare vintage bike. Amazing color. Rides good for it's age, brakes good, but don't expect to use it as a daily commuter. In other words it's 65 years old, it's heavy, it's more of a short distance weekend/pub crawl/farmers market show-off bike, not a daily commuter. You could make it into a daily commuter if you changed the wheels to something a little more modern and put a more comfortable seat on it. Would look amazing hanging on a wall too.\n",
