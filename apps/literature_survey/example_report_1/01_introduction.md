# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background: Large Language Models and In-Context Learning

Large language models (LLMs) are a class of deep learning models designed for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including language understanding, generation, and summarization. These models, typically built on the transformer architecture, are pre-trained on enormous corpora of text and then fine-tuned for specific applications [1,2]. Notable examples include BERT [3], GPT series [4], PaLM, LLaMA, and GPT-4, which have set new benchmarks in language modeling and downstream task performance.

In-context learning (ICL) is an emergent phenomenon where a language model learns to perform new tasks or adapt to novel data simply by conditioning on demonstrations provided within its input prompt, without any update to the model's parameters [5,6]. For example, given a sequence of input�Coutput pairs as context, LLMs such as GPT-3 can generalize and produce correct outputs for new instances, all within a single inference pass. This allows for zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning capabilities, distinguishing modern LLMs from earlier NLP systems that relied on explicit retraining.

## 1.2 Historical Context

The path from early neural language models to modern LLMs and ICL involves several key milestones:
- **Word Embeddings (2013):** Efficient vector-based representations using Word2Vec [7].
- **Sequence Models (2014�C2015):** Advances with RNNs and LSTMs for sequential data.
- **Transformers (2017):** Introduction of the transformer architecture [8], enabling context-dependent, parallelizable computations.
- **Pre-trained LLMs (2018):** Models like BERT [3] and GPT [4] showcased the effectiveness of large-scale pretraining and made fine-tuning universal for NLP tasks.
- **Emergence of ICL (2020):** Few-shot and zero-shot capabilities in GPT-3 [5] highlighted the potential for models to learn from context alone.
- **Scaling and Refinement (2021�C2024):** Continued progress with larger models (PaLM, LLaMA, GPT-4) and refined techniques.

For a deeper historical survey, see [9,10].

## 1.3 Why a Bayesian Perspective?

Despite their empirical success, the mechanisms by which LLMs perform in-context learning remain under active investigation. A salient line of research models ICL in LLMs as a form of **Bayesian inference** [11,12]. In this view, the model's predictions after conditioning on prompt demonstrations can be likened to the posterior distribution in Bayesian updating:

$$\mathrm{Posterior} \propto \mathrm{Likelihood} \times \mathrm{Prior}$$

When presented with new context in the prompt, the LLM may implicitly update its 'beliefs' about the correct function or label, much as a Bayesian learner updates its prior given new evidence. Understanding ICL in Bayesian terms yields several advantages:
- **Interpretability:** Provides a principled explanation for LLMs�� adaptive behavior.
- **Predictive Power:** Offers theoretical insight into generalization, scaling laws, and limitations.
- **Connections to Classical ML:** Links ICL to kernel regression, meta-learning, and nonparametric inference [13].

Recent works have formalized this intuition, analyzing LLMs�� output distributions for properties such as the martingale condition��a fundamental aspect of Bayesian updating [12]. Moreover, examining ICL through a Bayesian lens enables clearer diagnostics of when and why LLMs succeed or fail on new tasks.

## 1.4 Structure of This Survey

This literature survey is structured as follows:
- **Section 2:** Formal definitions and mathematical preliminaries for ICL, LLMs, and Bayesian inference.
- **Section 3:** Overview of empirical and theoretical studies on ICL in LLMs, with a focus on evidence for (and against) Bayesian mechanisms.
- **Section 4:** Connections to meta-learning, kernel methods, and alternative theoretical perspectives.
- **Section 5:** Open questions, future directions, and implications for model design.

By grounding the discussion in the Bayesian paradigm, we aim to clarify the current landscape and motivate further study.
