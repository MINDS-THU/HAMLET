## Model Architectures and Training Algorithms

### Pointer Networks
Pointer Networks [1] are sequence-to-sequence models that allow the output to be a permutation of the input, making them suitable for CO problems with ordering (e.g., TSP). The network outputs a sequence $\pi$ by attending over inputs at each decoding step.

- **Input:** Sequence of node embeddings $X = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ (e.g., city coordinates).
- **Output:** Permutation $\pi = (\pi_1, ..., \pi_n)$ of node indices.
- **RL Objective:** Maximize expected reward (e.g., negative tour length):

$$
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi \sim p_\theta(\cdot|X)} [R(\pi|X)]
$$

- **Policy Gradient Update:**

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [R(\pi|X) \nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(\pi|X)]
$$

### Attention Models (Transformers)
Kool et al. [2] proposed attention-based models for routing. These use self-attention to represent input graphs, improving generalization and scalability.
- **Input:** Same as pointer network.
- **Output:** Sequence decision via autoregressive decoding with masked softmax over nodes.
- **Objective and updates:** As above, typically with REINFORCE or rollout baseline variance reduction.

### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
GNNs [3,4] represent CO problems on graphs (nodes, edges), enabling message passing and flexible architectures for non-sequential tasks.
- **Input:** Graph $G=(V, E)$ with features.
- **Output:** Problem-dependent (e.g., label for each node/edge, or selection mask).
- **RL Objective:**

$$
J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi_\theta(\cdot|G)} [R(a|G)]
$$

where $a$ is an action (e.g., subset of nodes/edges).

### Policy Gradient and Actor-Critic Methods
Policy gradient [1,2] and actor-critic [4] are used to train models using sampled solution rewards.
- **Policy Gradient:**

$$
\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[R(s) \nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(a|s)]
$$

- **Actor-Critic Update:** The critic estimates value $V_\phi(s)$:

$$
L_{critic} = \lVert R(s) - V_\phi(s) \rVert^2
$$

The actor is updated with reduced-variance advantage:
$$
A(s, a) = R(s) - V_\phi(s)
$$


## Problem-Specific Applications and Case Studies

### TSP and VRP
- **Problem Statement:**
  - **TSP**: Given $n$ cities with coordinates $X$, find a permutation $\pi$ minimizing total length:
    $$
    \min_{\pi \in S_n} \sum_{i=1}^n d(x_{\pi_i}, x_{\pi_{i+1}})
    $$
    where $d$ is the Euclidean distance.
  - **VRP**: Extension where a vehicle visits nodes subject to capacity constraints.

- **DRL Solution:**
  - MDP setup: State = partial tour/route, Action = select next node, Reward = negative additional cost.
  - Model/Algorithm: Pointer network [1] or attention model [2], trained with policy gradient. Rollout baseline used for variance reduction.
  - Empirical findings: These approaches learn from scratch, outperform some heuristics, and generalize to larger instances better than supervised models [2].

### Graph Problems (Coloring, Max-Cut, MVC, etc.)
- **Problem Statement:**
  - **Max-Cut**: For graph $G=(V,E)$, partition $V$ to maximize cut weight:
    $$
    \max_{S \subseteq V} \sum_{(u,v) \in E} w_{uv} \cdot \mathbf{1}[u \in S, v \notin S]
    $$
  - **MVC/MWIS**: Find minimum vertex cover or maximum weight independent set.

- **DRL Solution:**
  - MDP setup: State = current partial solution, Action = node/edge selection, Reward = change in objective value.
  - Model: GNN-based policy [4], trained with actor-critic.
  - Empirical findings: GNN-RL solutions outperform classic heuristics on diverse graphs, can be retrained for new objectives [4].

### Scheduling/Other Problems
- **Problem Statement:**
  - E.g., Job-shop scheduling: Assign tasks $T$ to machines $M$ to minimize makespan.
- **DRL Solution:**
  - MDP: State = current schedule, Action = assign next task, Reward = negative increase in makespan.
  - Model: GNN or attention networks, trained via policy gradient or actor-critic.
  - Empirical findings: DRL can adapt to dynamic changes and constraints, with competitive performance but higher variance [5].
